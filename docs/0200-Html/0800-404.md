Custom 404 page
===============

Problem
-------

You want to show a customised "404" (page not found) page.

Solution
--------

In `Boot.scala` add the following:

```scala
LiftRules.uriNotFound.prepend(NamedPF("404handler"){
  case (req,failure) => 
    NotFoundAsTemplate(ParsePath(List("404"),"html",false,false))
})
```

The file `src/main/webapp/404.html` will now be served for requests to unknown resources.


Discussion
----------

The `uriNotFound` Lift rule needs to return a `NotFound` in reply to a `Req` (request) and optional `Failure`. This allows you to customise the response based on the type of failure or the request that was made.

There are three types of `NotFound`:

* `NotFoundAsTemplate` is useful to invoke the Lift template processing facilities from a `ParsePath`. 

* `NotFoundAsResponse` allows you to return a specific `LiftResponse`.

* `NotFoundAsNode` wrappers a `NodeSeq` for Lift to translate into a 404 response.

In case you're wondering, the two `false` arguments to `ParsePath` indicates the path we've given isn't absolute, and doesn't end in a slash.
