Setting meta tag contents
==========================

Problem
-------

You want to set the content of an HTML meta tag using Lift.

Solution
--------

Use the `@` CSS binding name selector.  For example, given:

```scala
<meta name="keywords" content="some words go here" />
```

The following snippet code will update the value of the contents attribute:

```scala
"@keywords [content]" #> "other words to use" 
```


Discussion
----------

The `@` selector selects all elements with the given name.  The `[content]` part matches on the attribute of `content`.  These are general mechanisms, not specific to meta tags.
