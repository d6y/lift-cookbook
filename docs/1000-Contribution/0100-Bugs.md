How to report bugs
==================

Problem
-------

You've found a bug and want to report it.

Solution
--------

Discuss your findings on the Lift mailing list, saying what you're seeing, and what you'd expect to see.

By all means look at [existing issues](http://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/tickets) to see if your issue is there or recently fixed, but do not raise a ticket unless asked to do so by a Lift committer on the mailing list.


Discussion
----------

__"If Lift is not behaving as you expect, please ask questions about what you're seeing. The ideal form of these questions is 'When I do X, my Lift app does Y, but I expect it to do Z, why?' This provides a set of language to discuss your application and the way that Lift responds to requests. Perhaps there's a way of improving Lift. Perhaps there's a concept that's different in Lift than you might be used to. Perhaps there's a documentation issue that can help bridge the gap between what Lift is doing and what you expect it to do. Most importantly, just because Lift is behaving differently than you expect it to, it's not necessarily a bug in Lift."__ (from [Expected Behavior in the Lift community](http://lift.la/expected-behavior-in-the-lift-community))
