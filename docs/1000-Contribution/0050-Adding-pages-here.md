How to add a new recipe to this Cookbook
========================================

Problem
-------

You'd like to add a new page to this cookbook.

Solution
--------

If you're comfortable using Git, you can fork the repository and send a push request.

Alternatively, download the template file, write your recipe, and email to the Lift mailing list.

The template is: [https://raw.github.com/d6y/lift-cookbook/master/template.md](https://raw.github.com/d6y/lift-cookbook/master/template.md)


Discussion
----------

The cookbook is structured using Markdown and Pamflet.  Each recipe is a file with the same structure as the template file, and gives one good solution to a problem.  Feel free to discuss alternatives or related concepts in the discussion section.

If you've forked the project from Github, you'll find all the pages in the `docs` folder, with sub-folders for each section.  The filenames are used for ordering the pages and sections.  Feel free to send pull requests.
