[quote, David Pollack, http://bit.ly/lift-expects]
____
If Lift is not behaving as you expect, please ask questions about what
you're seeing. The ideal form of these questions is "When I do X, my
Lift app does Y, but I expect it to do Z, why?" This provides a set of
language to discuss your application and the way that Lift responds to
requests. Perhaps there's a way of improving Lift. Perhaps there's a
concept that's different in Lift than you might be used to. Perhaps
there's a documentation issue that can help bridge the gap between what
Lift is doing and what you expect it to do. Most importantly, just
because Lift is behaving differently than you expect it to, it's not
necessarily a bug in Lift.
____

A great way to get help with the issue you have, or getting a bug fixed, is to produce a small example to illustrate the problem and post it on GitHub. The key is to provide instructions so someone can run the example and see exactly what you see without having to jump through hoops.

If you're asked to, or want to, post example code there's a guide http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Posting_example_code[here].

If you've found a bug, and you're asked to create a ticket, the main thing to do is include a link to the mailing list discussion of the issue, as described http://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb/Creating_tickets[here].


[[LiftCodeContributions]]
Contributing Small Code Changes and ScalaDoc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You have a small change or ScalaDoc improvement you'd like incorporated into Lift.((("Lift Web Framework", "submitting improvements to")))(((contributers, to Lift Web Framework)))((("code changes, contributing")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

You can issue pull requests against the Lift source, providing your change meets one of the following requirements:

* It's a change to a comment.
* It's example code.
* It's a _small_ change, enhancement, or bug fix to Lift.

Your pull request must include an edit to add your signature to the bottom of the _contributors.md_ file.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Historically, Lift had a strict contributor policy of simply not accepting any code contributions except from committers who had signed an agreement to assign copyright to the Lift project.  This allowed corporations wanting to adopt Lift to do so without litigation concerns.

The safety is still there, now via the requirement for a signature on the contributors file, which reads:

[quote]
____
By submitting this pull request which includes my name and email address (the email address may be in a non-robot readable format), I agree that the entirety of the contribution is my own original work, that there are no prior claims on this work including, but not limited to, any agreements I may have with my employer or other contracts, and that I license this work under an Apache 2.0 license.
____

What's a small change? That's a good question, and if you're unsure, talk about your proposed change on the mailing list.

Contributing Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You'd like to contribute documentation to Lift.(((contributers, to Lift Web Framework)))((("documentation, contribution of")))


Solution
^^^^^^^^

Update or add to the https://www.assembla.com/wiki/show/liftweb[Lift wiki].

You'll need to sign in, or create a free account, with Assembla, the company that hosts the wiki. You then need to become a _watcher_ of the Lift wiki, which is offered as a link on the top right of the Lift wiki page.  As a watcher, you can edit pages and create new pages.(((Assembla)))(((Lift wiki page)))


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

If you're unsure about a change you'd like to make, just ask for feedback on the Lift mailing list.


One limitation of the watcher role on Assembla is that you cannot move pages. If you create a new page in the wrong section, or want to reorganise pages, you'll need to ask on the Lift mailing list for someone with permissions to do that for you.

[[AddRecipe]]
How to Add a New Recipe to this Cookbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You'd like to add a section or chapter to this cookbook.((("Lift Cookbook", "submitting recipies to")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

If you're comfortable using Git, you can fork the repository and send a
pull request.((("templates", "for Lift Cookbook submissions")))

Alternatively, download a template file, write your recipe, and email it
to the https://groups.google.com/group/liftweb[Lift mailing list].

You can find the template file https://raw.github.com/d6y/lift-cookbook/master/etc/template.asciidoc[here].

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Anything you've puzzled over, or things that have surprised you, impressed you, or are nonobvious are great topics for recipes. Improvements, discussions, and clarifications of existing recipes are welcome, too.

The cookbook is structured using a markup language called AsciiDoc. If you're familiar with Markdown or Textile, you'll find similarities. For the cookbook, you only need to know about section headings, source code formatting, and links.  Examples of all of these are in the `template.asciidoc` file.(((AsciiDoc markup language)))(((Markdown)))(((Textile markup)))

To find out where to make a change, you need to know that each chapter is a separate file, and each recipe is a section in that file.


Licensing

Sharing Code in Modules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You have code you'd like to share between Lift projects or with the community.((("code sharing, modules for", id="ix_CSmf", range="startofrange")))((("modules, for code sharing", id="ix_Mcs", range="startofrange")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Create a Lift module, and then reference the module from your Lift projects.

As an example, let's create a module to embed the _snowstorm snowfall effect_ on every page in your Lift web application (please don't do this).

There's nothing special about modules: they are code, packaged and used like any other dependency. What makes them possible is the exposure of extension points via `LiftRules`. The main convention is to have an `init` method that Lift applications can use to initialize your module.

For our snowstorm, we're going to package some JavaScript and inject the script onto every page.

Starting with the _lift_blank_ template downloaded from _liftweb.net_, we can remove all the source and HTML files as this won't be a runnable Lift application in itself. However, it will leave us with the regular Lift structure and build configuration.

Our module will need the https://github.com/scottschiller/snowstorm/[snowstorm JavaScript file] copied as _resources/toserve/snowstorm.js_.  This will place the JavaScript file on the classpath of our Lift application.

The final piece of the module is to ensure the JavaScript is included on every page:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------
package net.liftmodules.snowstorm

import net.liftweb.http._

object Snowstorm {

 def init() : Unit = {

  ResourceServer.allow {
     case "snowstorm.js" :: Nil => true
  }

  def addSnow(s: LiftSession, r: Req) = S.putInHead(
    <script type="text/javascript" src="/classpath/snowstorm.js"></script> )

  LiftSession.onBeginServicing = addSnow _ :: LiftSession.onBeginServicing

 }

}
--------------------------------------------------------------

Here we are plugging into Lift's processing pipeline and adding the required
JavaScript to the head of every page.

We modify _build.sbt_ to give the module a name, organisation, and version number.  We also can remove many of the dependencies and the web plugin as we only depend on the web API elements of Lift:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------
name := "snowstorm"

version := "1.0.0"

organization := "net.liftmodules"

scalaVersion := "2.9.1"

resolvers ++= Seq(
   "snapshots" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots",
   "releases" at "http://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/releases"
)

scalacOptions ++= Seq("-deprecation", "-unchecked")

libraryDependencies ++= {
  val liftVersion = "2.5-RC5"
  Seq(
    "net.liftweb" %% "lift-webkit"  % liftVersion  % "compile"
  )
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

We can publish this plugin to the repository on disk by starting SBT and typing:

---------------------------
publish-local
---------------------------

With our module built and published, we can now include it in our Lift applications. To do that, modify the Lift application's _build.sbt_ to reference this new "snowstorm" dependency:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------
libraryDependencies ++= {
  val liftVersion = "2.5-RC5"
  Seq(
  ...
  "net.liftmodules" %% "snowstorm" % "1.0.0",
  ...
--------------------------------------------------------------

In our Lift application's _Boot.scala_, we finally initialise the plugin:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------
import net.liftmodules.snowstorm.Snowstorm
Snowstorm.init()
--------------------------------------------------------------

When we run our Lift application, white snow will be falling on every page, supplied by the module.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The module is self contained: there's no need for users to copy JavaScript files around or modify their templates.  To achieve that we've made use of `ResourceServer`.  When we reference the JavaScript file via _/classpath/snowstorm.js_, Lift will attempt to locate _snowstorm.js_ from the classpath.  This is what we want for our Lift application because _snowstorm.js_ will be inside the module JAR file.

However, we do not want to expose all files on the classpath to anyone visiting our application. To avoid that, Lift looks for resources inside a _toserve_ folder, which for our purposes means files and folders inside _src/main/resources/toserve_.  You can think of pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'><emphasis>/classpath</emphasis></phrase>] meaning _toserve_ (although, you can change those values via `LiftRules.resourceServerPath` and `ResourceServer.baseResourceLocation`).

As a further precaution, you need to explicitly allow access to these resources.  That's done with:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------
ResourceServer.allow {
  case "snowstorm.js" :: Nil => true
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

We're just always returning `true` for anyone who asks for this resource, but we could dynamically control access here if we wanted.

`S.putInHead` adds the JavaScript to the head of a page, and is triggered on every page by `LiftSession.onBeginServicing` (also discussed in <<OnSession>>). We could make use of `Req` here to restrict the snowstorm to particular pages, but we're adding it to every page.

Hopefully you can see that anything you can do in a Lift application you can probably turn into a Lift module.  A typical approach might be to have functionality in a Lift application, and then factor out settings in `Boot` into a module `init` method.  For example, if you wanted to provide REST services as a module, that would be possible and is an approach taken by the Lift PayPal module.

Making your module available
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

If you do want your module to be used by a wider audience, you need to publish it to a public repository, such as Sonatype or CloudBees. You'll also want to keep your module up-to-date with Lift releases. There are a few conventions around this.

One convention is to include the Lift "edition" as part of the module name.  For example, version 1.0.0 of your "foo" module for Lift 2.5 would have the name "foo_2.5." This makes it clear your module is compatible with Lift for all of 2.5, including milestones, release candidates, snapshots, and final releases.  It also means you only need publish your module once, at least until Lift 2.6 or 3.0 is available.

One way to ease the above is to make a modification to your module build to allow the Lift version number to change. This makes it possible to automate the build when new versions of Lift are released. To do that, create _project/LiftModule.scala_ in your module:


[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------
import sbt._
import sbt.Keys._

object LiftModuleBuild extends Build {

  val liftVersion = SettingKey[String]("liftVersion",
    "Full version number of the Lift Web Framework")

  val liftEdition = SettingKey[String]("liftEdition",
    "Lift Edition (short version number to append to artifact name)")

  val project = Project("LiftModule", file("."))
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

This defines a setting to control the Lift version number.  You use it in your module _build.sbt_ like this:

[source,scala]
--------------------------------------------------------------
name := "snowstorm"

organization := "net.liftmodules"

version := "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"

liftVersion <<= liftVersion ?? "2.5-SNAPSHOT"

liftEdition <<= liftVersion apply { _.substring(0,3) }

name <<= (name, liftEdition) { (n, e) =>  n + "_" + e }

...

libraryDependencies <++= liftVersion { v =>
  "net.liftweb" %% "lift-webkit" % v % "provided" ::
  Nil
}
--------------------------------------------------------------

Note the `"provided"` configuration for Lift in the build file. This means that when your module is used, the version of Lift's WebKit will be the version provided by the application being built by the person using your module.

What the above gives you is a way for your module to depend on Lift ("2.5"), without locking your module into a specific release if it happens to be built with "2.5-SNAPSHOT." By using a setting of `liftVersion`, we can control the version via a script for all modules.  This is what we do to publish a range of Lift modules after each Lift release, as described https://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/Releasing_the_modules[here].

When your module is built, don't forget to announce it on the Lift mailing list.

Debugging your module
+++++++++++++++++++++

When working on a module and testing it in a Lift application, it would be a chore to have to publish your module each time you changed it. Fortunately, SBT allows your Lift application to depend on the source of a module.  To use this, change your Lift project to remove the dependency on the published module and instead add a local dependency by creating _project/LocalModuleDev.scala_:


[source,scala]
------------------------------------
import sbt._
object LocalModuleDev extends Build {
  lazy val root = Project("", file(".")) dependsOn(snow)
  lazy val snow = ProjectRef(uri("../snowstorm"), "LiftModule")
}
------------------------------------

We are assuming that the snowstorm source can be found at _../snowstorm_ relative to the Lift application we are using. With this in place, when you build your Lift project, SBT will automatically compile and depend on changes in the local `snowstorm` module.

Originally, Lift included a set of modules, but these have been separated out to https://github.com/liftmodules/[individual projects].  The Lift contributor policy outlined in <<LiftCodeContributions>> doesn't apply to Lift modules: you're free to contribute to these modules as you would any other open source project.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_CSmf")))

The Lift wiki pages for modules can be reached via http://liftmodules.net[http://liftmodules.net].

The Snowstorm project ("setting CPUs on fire worldwide every winter since 2003") is https://github.com/scottschiller/snowstorm/[here] and the module developed for this recipe is https://github.com/LiftCookbook/snowstorm-example-module[here].

To publish to Sonatype, take a look at https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide[their guide]. CloudBees offers an http://www.cloudbees.com/foss/foss-dev.cb[open source repository].

There are other ways to structure common code between Lift applications. For an example that uses SBT modules and Git, see the http://bit.ly/lift-moduleapp[mailing list discussion on "Modularize Lift Applications"].
