Generating HTML is often a major component of web applications.  This chapter is concerned with Lift's _View First_ approach and use of _CSS Selectors_.  Later chapters focus more specifically on form processing, REST web services, JavaScript, Ajax, and Comet.((("Lift Web Framework", "view first approach of")))((("view first approach", "CSS selectors and")))

[[TestingAndDebuggingSelectors]]
Testing and Debugging CSS Selectors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to explore or debug CSS selectors interactively.((("CSS selectors", "testing/debugging")))((("interactive development", "CSS selector debugging")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

You can use the Scala REPL to run your CSS selectors.(((Scala, REPL CSS selector testing)))

Here's an example were we test out a CSS selector that adds an _href_ attribute to a link.
Start from within SBT and use the `console` command to get into the REPL:

----

[source,scala]
----
scala> import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._

scala> val f = "a [href]" #> "http://example.org"
f: net.liftweb.util.CssSel =
  (Full(a [href]), Full(ElemSelector(a,Full(AttrSubNode(href)))))

scala> val in = <a>click me</a>
in: scala.xml.Elem = <a>click me</a>

scala> f(in)
res0: scala.xml.NodeSeq =
  NodeSeq(<a href="http://example.org">click me</a>)
----

The `Helpers._` import brings in the CSS selector functionality, which we then exercise by creating a selector, `f`, calling it with a very simple template, `in`, and observing the result, `res0`.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

CSS selector transforms are one of the distinguishing features of Lift. They succinctly describe a node in your template (lefthand side) and give a replacement (operation, the righthand side). They do take a little while to get used to, so being able to test them at the Scala REPL is useful.((("Lift Web Framework", "CSS selector transforms")))

It may help to know that prior to CSS selectors, Lift snippets were typically defined in terms
of a function that took a `NodeSeq` and returned a `NodeSeq`, often via a method called `bind`. Lift would take your template, which would be the input `NodeSeq`, apply the function, and return a new `NodeSeq`.  You won't see that usage so often any more, but the principle is the same.((("Lift Web Framework", "snippets in")))(((snippets)))

The CSS selector functionality in Lift gives you a `CssSel` function,
which is `NodeSeq => NodeSeq`. We exploit this in the above example by constructing an input
`NodeSeq` (called `in`), then creating a CSS function (called `f`).  Because we know that `CssSel`
is defined as a `NodeSeq => NodeSeq`, the natural way to execute the selector is to supply
the `in` as a parameter, and this gives us the answer, `res0`.

If you use an IDE that supports a _worksheet_, which both Eclipse and IntelliJ IDEA do, then you can also run transformations in a worksheet.

[[SequencingSelectorOps]]
Sequencing CSS Selector Operations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want your CSS selector binding to apply to the results of earlier
binding expressions.((("CSS selectors", "applying to earlier expressions")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use `andThen` rather than `&` to compose your selector expressions.(((andThen selector expressions)))((("& selector expressions")))

For example, suppose we want to replace `<div id="foo"/>` with
`<div id="bar">bar content</div>` but for some reason we needed to
generate the `bar` div as a separate step in the selector expression:

----
sbt> console
[info] Starting scala interpreter...
[info]
Welcome to Scala version 2.9.1.final (Java 1.7.0_05).
Type in expressions to have them evaluated.
Type :help for more information.
----

[source,scala]
----
scala> import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._

scala> def render = "#foo" #> <div id="bar"/> andThen "#bar *" #> "bar content"
render: scala.xml.NodeSeq => scala.xml.NodeSeq

scala> render(<div id="foo"/>)
res0: scala.xml.NodeSeq = NodeSeq(<div id="bar">bar content</div>)
----

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

When using `&`, think of the CSS selectors as always applying to the
original template, no matter what other expressions you are combining.
This is because `&` is aggregating the selectors together before applying them. In contrast, `andThen` is
a method of all Scala functions that composes two functions together, with the first being
called before the second.

Compare the example above if we change the `andThen` to
`&`:

[source,scala]
----
scala> def render = "#foo" #> <div id="bar" /> & "#bar *" #> "bar content"
render: net.liftweb.util.CssSel

scala> render(<div id="foo"/>)
res1: scala.xml.NodeSeq = NodeSeq(<div id="bar"></div>)
----

The second expression will not match, as it is applied to the original
input of ++<div id="foo"/>++—the selector of `#bar` won't match on `id=foo`,
and so adds nothing to the results of `render`.

https://www.assembla.com/spaces/liftweb/wiki/Binding_via_CSS_Selectors[The Lift wiki page for CSS selectors] also describes this use of `andThen`.




[[SetMetaTag]]
Setting Meta Tag Contents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to set the content of an HTML meta tag from a snippet.((("meta tag contents, setting")))(((snippets)))(((HTML meta tags)))((("CSS selectors", "setting meta tage contents with")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use the `@` CSS binding name selector. For example, given((("@ selector expressions))):

[source,html]
----
<meta name="keywords" content="words, here, please" />
----

The following snippet code will update the value of the content
attribute:

[source,scala]
----
"@keywords [content]" #> "words, we, really, want"
----

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The `@` selector selects all elements with the given name. It's useful in this case to change the `<meta name="keyword">` tag, but you may also see it used elsewhere. For example, in an HTML form you can select input fields such as `<input name="address">` with `"@address"`.(((forms processing, HTML input fields)))

The `[content]` part is an example of a _replacement rule_ that can follow a selector. That's to say, it's not specific to the `@` selector and can be used with other selectors.  In this example, it replaces the value of the attribute called "content."  If the meta tag had no "content" attribute, it would be added.(((replacement rules)))(((attributes)))

There are two other replacement rules useful for manipulating attributes:

* `[content!]` to remove an attribute with a matching value.
* `[content+]` to append to the value.

Examples of these would be:

[source,scala]
----
scala> import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._

scala> val in = <meta name="keywords" content="words, here, please" />
in: scala.xml.Elem = <meta name="keywords" content="words, here, please"></meta>

scala> val remove = "@keywords [content!]" #> "words, here, please"
remove: net.liftweb.util.CssSel = CssBind(Full(@keywords [content!]),
  Full(NameSelector(keywords,Full(AttrRemoveSubNode(content)))))

scala> remove(in)
res0: scala.xml.NodeSeq = NodeSeq(<meta name="keywords"></meta>)
----

and:

[source,scala]
----
scala> val add = "@keywords [content+]" #> ", thank you"
add: net.liftweb.util.CssSel = CssBind(Full(@keywords [content+]),
  Full(NameSelector(keywords,Full(AttrAppendSubNode(content)))))

scala> add(in)
res1: scala.xml.NodeSeq = NodeSeq(<meta content="words, here, please, thank you"
  name="keywords"></meta>)
----

Appending to a class attribute
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Although not directly relevant to `meta` tags, you should be aware that there is one convenient special case for appending to an attribute. If the attribute is `class`, a space is added together with your class value.(((class attributes))) As a demonstration of that, here's an example of appending a class called "btn-primary" to a `div`:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------------------
scala> def render = "div [class+]" #> "btn-primary"
render: net.liftweb.util.CssSel

scala> render(<div class="btn"/>)
res0: scala.xml.NodeSeq = NodeSeq(<div class="btn btn-primary"></div>)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

[[SetPageTitle]]
Setting the Page Title
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to set the `<title>` of the page from a Lift snippet.(((element selectors)))(((page titles)))((("titles, page titles")))(((snippets)))((("names/naming", "page titles")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Select the content of the `title` element and replace it with the
text you want:

[source,scala]
----
"title *" #> "I am different"
----

Assuming you have a `<title>` tag in your template, the above will
result in:

[source,html]
----
<title>I am different</title>
----

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

This example uses an element selector, which picks out tags in the HTML template, and replaces the content.  Notice that we are using `"title *"` to select the _content_ of the title tag. If we had left off the `*`, the entire title tag would have been replaced with text.

As an alternative, it is also possible to set the page title from the contents of `SiteMap`,
meaning the title used will be the title you've assigned to the page in
the site map.  To do that, make use of `Menu.title` in your template directly:

[source,html]
----
<title data-lift="Menu.title"></title>
----

The `Menu.title` code appends to any existing text in the title.
This means the following will have the phrase `"Site Title - "` in the
title followed by the page title:

[source,html]
----
<title data-lift="Menu.title">Site Title - </title>
----

If you need more control, you can of course bind on `<title>` using a
regular snippet. This example uses a custom snippet to put the site
title after the page title:

[source,html]
----
<title data-lift="MyTitle"></title>
-----

[source,scala]
----
object MyTitle {
  def render = <title><lift:Menu.title /> - Site Title</title>
}
----

Notice that our snippet is returning another snippet, `<lift:Menu.title/>`.  This is a perfectly normal thing to do in Lift, and snippet invocations returned from snippets will be processed by Lift as normal.

See Also
^^^^^^^^

<<SnippetNotFound>> describes the different ways to reference a snippet, such as `data-lift` and `<lift: ... />`.

[[ConditionalIncludes]]
HTML Conditional Comments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to make use of Internet Explorer HTML conditional comments(((HTML conditional comments)))((("Internet Explorer, conditional comments")))((("templates", "using IE HTML conditional comments in")))(((conditional comments))) in your pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'>templates.</phrase>]

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Put the markup in a snippet and include the snippet in your page or
template.(((snippets)))

For example, suppose we want to include the HTML5 Shiv (a.k.a. HTML5 Shim) JavaScript so we can use HTML5
elements with legacy IE browsers.  To do that, our snippet would be((("browsers", "using legacy"))):

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import scala.xml.Unparsed

object Html5Shiv {
  def render = Unparsed("""<!--[if lt IE 9]>
    <script src="http://html5shim.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/html5.js">
    </script><![endif]-->""")
}
----

We would then reference the snippet in the `<head>` of a page, perhaps even in
all pages via _templates-hidden/default.html_:

[source,html]
----
<script data-lift="Html5Shiv"></script>
----

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The HTML5 parser used by Lift does not carry comments from the source
through to the rendered page. If you just tried to paste the _html5shim_ markup into
your template you'd find it missing from the rendered page.(((HTML5 parser)))

We deal with this by generating unparsed markup from a snippet. If you're looking at
`Unparsed` and worried, your instincts are correct.  Normally, Lift would cause the
markup to be escaped, but in this case we really do want
unparsed XML content (the comment tag) included in the output.(((unparsed XML content)))

If you find you're using IE conditional comments frequently, you may want to create a more general version of the snippet.
For example:

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import xml.{NodeSeq, Unparsed}
import net.liftweb.http.S

object IEOnly {

  private def condition : String =
    S.attr("cond") openOr "IE"

  def render(ns: NodeSeq) : NodeSeq =
    Unparsed("<!--[if " + condition + "]>") ++ ns ++ Unparsed("<![endif]-->")
}
----

It would be used like this:

[source,html]
----
<div data-lift="IEOnly">
  A div just for IE
</div>
----

and produces output like this:

[source,html]
----
<!--[if IE]><div>
  A div just for IE
</div><![endif]-->
----

Notice that the `condition` test defaults to "IE," but first tries to look for an attribute called "cond."  This allows you to write:

[source,html]
----
<div data-lift="IEOnly?cond=lt+IE+9">
  You're using IE 8 or earlier
</div>
----

The `+` symbol is the the URL encoding for a space, resulting in:

[source,html]
----
<!--[if lt IE 9]><div>
  You're using IE 8 or earlier
</div><![endif]-->
----

[[PassThru]]
Returning Snippet Markup Unchanged
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want a snippet to return the original markup associated with the
snippet invocation.(((snippets)))(((PassThru transform)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use the `PassThru` transform.

Suppose you have a snippet that performs a transform when some
condition is met, but if the condition is not met, you want the snippet to
return the original markup.

Starting with the original markup:

[source,html]
----
<h2>Pass Thru Example</h2>

<p>There's a 50:50 chance of seeing "Try again" or "Congratulations!":</p>

<div data-lift="PassThruSnippet">
  Try again - this is the template content.
</div>
----

we could leave it alone or change it with this snippet:

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.util.PassThru

import scala.util.Random
import xml.Text

class PassThruSnippet {

  private def fiftyFifty = Random.nextBoolean

  def render =
    if (fiftyFifty) "*" #> Text("Congratulations! The content was changed")
    else PassThru

}
----

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

`PassThru` is an _identity function_ of type `NodeSeq => NodeSeq`. It returns the input it
is given(((identity functions))):

[source, scala]
-----
object PassThru extends Function1[NodeSeq, NodeSeq] {
  def apply(in: NodeSeq): NodeSeq = in
}
-----

A related example is `ClearNodes`, defined as:

[source, scala]
-----
object ClearNodes extends Function1[NodeSeq, NodeSeq] {
  def apply(in: NodeSeq): NodeSeq = NodeSeq.Empty
}
-----

The pattern of converting one `NodeSeq` to another is simple, but also powerful enough to get you out of most situations as you can always arbitrarily rewrite the `NodeSeq`.







[[SnippetNotFound]]
Snippet Not Found When Using HTML 5
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You're using Lift with the HTML 5 parser and one of your snippets is rendering with a "Class Not
Found" error.((("error messages", "Class Not Found")))(((Class Not Found error message)))(((HTML5 parser)))(((snippets))) It even happens for `<lift:HelloWorld.howdy />`.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Switch to the designer-friendly snippet invocation mechanism. For example((("Lift Web Framework", "as designer-friendly"))):

[source,html]
----
<div data-lift="HellowWorld.howdy"></div>
----

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

In this Cookbook we use the HTML 5 parser, which is set in _Boot.scala_:

[source,scala]
-----
// Use HTML5 for rendering
LiftRules.htmlProperties.default.set( (r: Req) =>
  new Html5Properties(r.userAgent) )
----


The HTML5 parser and the traditional Lift XHTML parser have different
behaviours. In particular, the HTML5 parser converts elements and attribute names to lowercase when looking up snippets. This means Lift would take `<lift:HelloWorld.howdy />` and look for a class called "helloworld" rather than "HelloWorld," which would be the cause of the "Class Not Found" error.

Switching to the designer-friendly mechanism is the solution here, and you gain validating HTML as a bonus.

There are three popular ways of referencing a snippet:

* As an HTML 5 data attribute: `data-lift="MySnippet"`. This is the style we use in this book, and is valid HTML 5 markup.

* Using the `lift` attribute, as in: `lift="MySnippet"`. This won't strictly validate against HTML 5, but you may see it.

* The XHTML namespace version: `<lift:MySnippet />`. You'll see the usage of this tag in templates declining because of the way it interacts with the HTML5 parser. However, it works just fine outside of a template, for example when embedding a snippet invocation in your server-side code (<<SetPageTitle>> includes an example of this for `Menu.title`).(((XHTML parser)))

[[AvoidAssetCaching]]
Avoiding CSS and JavaScript Caching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You've modified CSS or JavaScript in your application, but web browsers
have cached your resources and are using the older versions. You'd like
to avoid this browser caching.((("browsers", "avoiding caching")))(((CSS caching)))(((JavaScript caching)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Add the `with-resource-id` attribute to script or link tags(((resource ID attribute))):

[source,html]
----
<script data-lift="with-resource-id" src="/myscript.js"
 type="text/javascript"></script>
----

The addition of this attribute will cause Lift to append a _resource ID_ to
your `src` (or `href`), and as this resource ID changes each time Lift
starts, it defeats browser caching.

The resultant HTML might be:

[source,html]
----
<script src="/myscript.js?F619732897824GUCAAN=_"
  type="text/javascript" ></script>
----

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The random value that is appended to the resource is computed when your Lift application boots.  This means it should be stable between releases of your application.

If you need some other behaviour from `with-resource-id`, you can assign
a new function of type `String => String` to
`LiftRules.attachResourceId`. The default implementation, shown above,
takes the resource name, _/myscript.js_ in the example, and returns the
resource name with an ID appended.

You can also wrap a number of tags inside a
`<lift:with-resource-id>...<lift:with-resource-id>` block. However,
avoid doing this in the `<head>` of your page as the HTML5 parser will
move the tags to be outside of the head section.

Note that some proxies may choose not to cache resources with query
parameters at all. If that impacts you, it's possible to code a custom resource ID method
to move the random resource ID out of the query parameter and into the path.

Here's one approach to doing this. Rather than generate JavaScript and CSS links that look like _/assets/style.css?F61973_, we will generate _/cache/F61973/assets/style.css_. We then will need to tell Lift to take requests
that look like this new format, and render the correct content for the request.  The code for this is:

[source, scala]
-----------
package code.lib

import net.liftweb.util._
import net.liftweb.http._

object CustomResourceId {

 def init() : Unit = {
  // The random number we're using to avoid caching
  val resourceId = Helpers.nextFuncName

  // Prefix with-resource-id links with "/cache/{resouceId}"
  LiftRules.attachResourceId = (path: String) => {
   "/cache/" + resourceId + path
  }

  // Remove the cache/{resourceId} from the request if there is one
  LiftRules.statelessRewrite.prepend( NamedPF("BrowserCacheAssist") {
   case RewriteRequest(ParsePath("cache" :: id :: file, suffix, _, _), _, _) =>
    RewriteResponse(file, suffix)
  })

 }
}
-----------

This would be initialised in _Boot.scala_:

[source, scala]
-----------
CustomResourceId.init()
-----------

or you could just paste all the code into _Boot.scala_, if you prefer.

With the code in place, we can, for example, modify _templates-hidden/default.html_ and add a resource ID class to jQuery:

[source, html]
-----------
<script id="jquery" data-lift="with-resource-id"
  src="/classpath/jquery.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
-----------

At runtime this would be rendered in HTML as:

[source, html]
-----------
<script type="text/javascript" id="jquery"
  src="/cache/F352555437877UHCNRW/classpath/jquery.js"></script>
-----------

Most of the work for this is happening in the `statelessRewrite`, which is working at a low-level inside Lift. The two parts to it are:

* A `RewriteRequest` that is the pattern we're matching on, and
* A `RewriteResponse` that is the result we want if the request matches.

Looking at the `RewriteRequest` first, this expects three arguments: the path, which we care about, and then the method (e.g., `GetRequest`, `PutRequest`) and the `HTTPRequest` itself, neither of which concern us in this instance.  In the path part, we're matching on patterns that start with "cache" followed by something (we don't care what), and then the rest of the path, represented by the name `file`.  In that situation, we rewrite to the original path, which is just the `file` with the `suffix`, effectively removing the _/cache/F352555437877UHCNRW_ part.  This is the content that Lift will serve.

[[AddToHead]]
Adding to the Head of a Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You use a template for layout, but on one specific page you need to add
something to the `<head>` section.((("templates", "adding to the head section")))((("head section, adding to")))(((snippets)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use the `head` snippet so Lift knows to merge the
contents with the `<head>` of your page. For example, suppose you have
the following contents in _templates-hidden/default.html_:

[source,html]
----
<html lang="en" xmlns:lift="http://liftweb.net/">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"></meta>
    <title data-lift="Menu.title">App: </title>
    <script id="jquery" src="/classpath/jquery.js"
      type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script id="json" src="/classpath/json.js"
      type="text/javascript"></script>
 </head>
 <body>
     <div id="content">The main content will get bound here</div>
 </body>
</html>
----

Also suppose you have _index.html_ on which you want to include _red-titles.css_ to change the style of just this page.

Do so by including the CSS in the part of the page that will get processed, and mark it with the `head` snippet:

[source,html]
-----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
 <head>
   <title>Special CSS</title>
 </head>
 <body data-lift-content-id="main">
  <div id="main" data-lift="surround?with=default;at=content">
    <link data-lift="head" rel="stylesheet"
       href="red-titles.css" type="text/css" />
    <h2>Hello</h2>
  </div>
 </body>
</html>
-----

Note that this _index.html_ page is validated HTML5, and will produce a
result with the custom CSS inside the `<head>` tag, something like this:

[source,html]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
 <head>
  <meta charset="utf-8">
  <title>App:  Special CSS</title>
  <script type="text/javascript"
    src="/classpath/jquery.js" id="jquery"></script>
  <script type="text/javascript"
    src="/classpath/json.js" id="json"></script>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="red-titles.css" type="text/css">
 </head>
 <body>
   <div id="main">
     <h2>Hello</h2>
   </div>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="/ajax_request/liftAjax.js"></script>

If you find your tags not appearing in the `<head>` section, check that
the HTML in your template and page is valid HTML5.(((HTML5 markup issues)))

You can also use `<lift:head>...</lift:head>` to wrap a number of
expressions, and will see `<head_merge>...</head_merge>` used in code
example as an alternative to `<lift:head>`.

Another variant you may see is `class="lift:head"`, as an alternative to `data-lift="head"`.

The `head` snippet is a built-in snippet, but otherwise no different from any snippet you might write.  What the snippet does is emit a `<head>` block, containing the elements you want in the head.  These can be `<title>`, `<link>`, `<meta>`, `<style>`, `<script>`, or `<base>` tags.  How does this `<head>` block produced by the `head` snippet end up inside the main `<head>` section of the page?  When Lift processes your template, it automatically merges all `<head>` tags into the main `<head>` section of the page.

You might suspect you can therefore put a plain old `<head>` section anywhere on your template. You can, but that would not necessarily be valid HTML5 markup.

There's also `tail`, which works in a similar way, except anything marked with this snippet is moved to be just before the close of the body tag.

[[Custom404]]
Custom 404 Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to show a customised "404" (not found) page.((("error messages", "404 (not found) pages")))((("404 (not found) pages", sortas="fourzerofour")))((("404 (not found) pages")))((("page not found (404 error) message")))(((not found messages)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

In _Boot.scala_ add the following:

[source,scala]
----
import net.liftweb.util._
import net.liftweb.http._

LiftRules.uriNotFound.prepend(NamedPF("404handler"){
  case (req,failure) =>
    NotFoundAsTemplate(ParsePath(List("404"),"html",true,false))
})
----

The file _src/main/webapp/404.html_ will now be served for requests to
unknown pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'>resources.</phrase>]

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The `uriNotFound` Lift rule needs to return a `NotFound` in reply to a
`Req` and `Box[Failure]`. This allows you to customise the
response based on the request and the type of failure.

There are three types of `NotFound`:

`NotFoundAsTemplate`:: Useful to invoke the Lift template processing
facilities from a `ParsePath`
`NotFoundAsResponse`:: Allows you to return a specific `LiftResponse`
`NotFoundAsNode`:: Wraps a `NodeSeq` for Lift to translate into a 404
response

In the example, we're matching any not found situation, regardless of the request and the failure, and evaluating
this as a resource identified by `ParsePath`.  The path we've used is _/404.html_.

In case you're wondering, the last two `true` and `false` arguments to `ParsePath`
indicates the path we've given is absolute, and doesn't end in a
slash.  `ParsePath` is a representation for a URI path, and exposing
if the path is absolute or ends in a slash are useful flags for matching on, but
in this case, they're not relevant.

Be aware that 404 pages, when rendered this way, won't have a location in the site map. That's because we've not included the _404.html_ file in the site map, and we don't have to because we're rendering via `NotFoundAsTemplate` rather than sending a redirect to pass:[<phrase role='keep-together'><emphasis>/404.html</emphasis>.</phrase>] However, this means that if you display an error page using a template that contains `Menu.builder` or similar (as _templates-hidden/default.html_ does), you'll see "No Navigation Defined."  In that case, you'll probably want to use a different template on your 404 page.

As an alternative, you could include the 404 page in your site map but make it hidden when the site map is displayed via the `Menu.builder`:

[source,scala]
----
Menu.i("404") / "404" >> Hidden

[[CustomStatusPage]]
Other Custom Status Pages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to show a customised page for certain HTTP status codes.(((HTTP status codes)))(((custom HTTP status pages)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use `LiftRules.responseTransformers` to match against the response and
supply an alternative.

As an example, suppose we want to provide a custom page for 403
("Forbidden") statuses created in our Lift application.  Further, suppose that
this page might contain snippets so will need to pass through the Lift
rendering flow.((("403 (forbidden) statuses")))((("403 (forbidden) statuses", sortas="fourzerothree")))((("forbidden (403) status pages")))

To do this in _Boot.scala_, we define the `LiftResponse` we want to generate
and use the response when a 403 status is about to be produced by Lift:

[source,scala]
----
def my403 : Box[LiftResponse] =
  for {
    session <- S.session
    req <- S.request
    template = Templates("403" :: Nil)
    response <- session.processTemplate(template, req, req.path, 403)
  } yield response

LiftRules.responseTransformers.append {
  case resp if resp.toResponse.code == 403 => my403 openOr resp
  case resp => resp
}
----

The file _src/main/webapp/403.html_ will now be served for requests that
generate 403 status codes. Other non-403 responses are left untouched.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

`LiftRules.responseTransformers` allows you to supply
`LiftResponse => LiftResponse` functions to change a response right at the end
of the HTTP processing cycle. This is a very general mechanism: in this
example, we are matching on a status code, but we could match on anything
exposed by `LiftResponse`.


In the recipe, we respond with a template, but you may find
situations where other kinds of response make sense, such as an `InMemoryResponse`.

You could even simplify the example to just this:

[source,scala]
----
LiftRules.responseTransformers.append {
  case resp if resp.toResponse.code == 403 => RedirectResponse("/403.html")
  case resp => resp
}
----

[NOTE]
In Lift 3 `responseTransformers` will be modified to be a partial function, meaning you'll be able to leave off the final `case r => r` part of this example.

That redirect will work just fine, with the only downside that the HTTP status code sent back to the web browser won't be a 403 code.

A more general approach, if you're customising a number of pages, would be to define the status codes you want to
customise, create a page for each, and then only match on those pages:

[source,scala]
----
LiftRules.responseTransformers.append {
  case Customised(resp) => resp
  case resp => resp
}

object Customised {

  // The pages we have customised: 403.html and 500.html
  val definedPages = 403 :: 500 :: Nil

  def unapply(resp: LiftResponse) : Option[LiftResponse] =
    definedPages.find(_ == resp.toResponse.code).flatMap(toResponse)

  def toResponse(status: Int) : Box[LiftResponse] =
    for {
      session <- S.session
      req <- S.request
      template = Templates(status.toString :: Nil)
      response <- session.processTemplate(template, req, req.path, status)
  } yield response

}
----

The convention in `Customised` is that we have an HTML file in _src/main/webapp_ that matches
the status code we want to show, but of course you can change that by using a different
pattern in the argument to `Templates`.

One way to test the above examples is to add the following to _Boot.scala_ to
make all requests to _/secret_ return a 403:

[source,scala]
----
val Protected = If(() => false, () => ForbiddenResponse("No!"))

val entries = List(
  Menu.i("Home") / "index",
  Menu.i("secret") / "secret" >> Protected,
  // rest of your site map here...
)
----

If you request _/secret_, a 403 response will be triggered, which will match the response transformer showing you
the contents of the _403.html_ template.

Links in Notices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to include a clickable link in your `S.error`, `S.notice`, or
`S.warning` messages.((("links, clickable")))(((clickable links)))(((error messages, clickable links in)))((("S.error messages")))((("S.notice messages")))((("S.warning messages")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Include a `NodeSeq` containing a link in your notice:

[source,scala]
----
S.error("checkPrivacyPolicy",
  <span>See our <a href="/policy">privacy policy</a></span>)
----

You might pair this with the following in your template...

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<span data-lift="Msg?id=checkPrivacyPolicy"></span>
---------------------------------------------------------


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

You may be more familiar with the `S.error(String)` signature of Lift notices than the versions
that take a `NodeSeq` as an argument, but the `String` versions just convert the `String` argument
to a `scala.xml.Text` kind of `NodeSeq`.

[[DownloadLink]]
Link to Download Data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want a button or a link that, when clicked, will trigger a download in the browser rather than visiting a page.((("browsers", "downloads vs. visits")))(((clickable links)))((("downloads, triggering")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Create a link using `SHtml.link`, provide a function to return a `LiftResponse` and wrap the response in a `ResponseShortcutException`.

As an example, we will create a snippet that shows the user a poem and provides a link to download the poem as a text file.  The template for this snippet will present each line of the poem separated by a `<br>`:

[source, html]
-------------------------------------------------------------
<h1>A poem</h1>

<div data-lift="DownloadLink">
  <blockquote>
    <span class="poem">
        <span class="line">line goes here</span> <br />
    </span>
  </blockquote>
  <a href="">download link here</a>
</div>
-------------------------------------------------------------

The snippet itself will render the poem and replace the download link with one that will send a
response that the browser will interpret as a file to download:

[source, scala]
-------------------------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http._
import xml.Text

class DownloadLink {

  val poem =
    "Roses are red," ::
    "Violets are blue," ::
    "Lift rocks!" ::
    "And so do you." :: Nil

  def render =
    ".poem" #> poem.map(line => ".line" #> line) &
    "a" #> downloadLink

  def downloadLink =
    SHtml.link("/notused",
      () => throw new ResponseShortcutException(poemTextFile),
      Text("Download") )

  def poemTextFile : LiftResponse =
    InMemoryResponse(
      poem.mkString("\n").getBytes("UTF-8"),
      "Content-Type" -> "text/plain; charset=utf8" ::
      "Content-Disposition" -> "attachment; filename=\"poem.txt\"" :: Nil,
      cookies=Nil, 200)
}
-------------------------------------------------------------

Recall that `SHtml.link` generates a link and executes a function you supply before following the link.

The trick here is that wrapping the `LiftResponse` in a `ResponseShortcutException` will indicate
to Lift that the response is complete, so the page being linked to (in this case, `notused`) won't be processed. The browser is happy: it has a response to the link the user clicked on, and will render it how it wants to, which in this case will probably be by saving the file to disk.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

`SHtml.link` works by generating a URL that Lift associates with the function you give it. On a page called `downloadlink`, the URL will look something like:

---------------------------------------------
downloadlink?F845451240716XSXE3G=_#notused
---------------------------------------------

When that link is followed, Lift looks up the function and executes it, before processing the linked-to resource. However, in this case, we are shortcutting the Lift pipeline by throwing this particular exception.  This is caught by Lift and the response wrapped by the exception is taken as the final response from the request.(((request pipeline, shortcutting)))

This shortcutting is used by `S.redirectTo` via `ResponseShortcutException.redirect`. This companion object also defines `shortcutResponse`, which you can use like this:

[source, scala]
----------------------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.http.ResponseShortcutException._

def downloadLink =
  SHtml.link("/notused",
    () => {
      S.notice("The file was downloaded")
      throw shortcutResponse(poemTextFile)
    },
    Text("Download") )
----------------------------------------------------

We've included an `S.notice` to highlight that `throw shortcutResponse` will process Lift notices when the page next loads, whereas `throw new ResponseShortcutException` does not.  In this case, the notice will not appear when the user downloads the file, but it will be included the next time notices are shown, such as when the user navigates to another page.  For many situations, the difference is immaterial.

This recipe has used Lift's stateful features.  You can see how useful it is to be able to close over state (the poem), and offer the data for download from memory.  If you've created a report from a database, you can offer it as a download without having to regenerate the items from the database.((("Lift Web Framework", "stateful features of")))(((REST web services, and report generation")))((("reports, generating")))

However, in other situations you might want to avoid holding this data as a function on a link. In that case, you'll want to create a REST service that returns a `LiftResponse`.

[[TestingReq]]
Test on a Req
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to be able to test a function that needs a `Req`.((("functions, testing of")))((("requests, creating mock")))(((mock requests)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Supply a mock request to Lift's `MockWeb.testReq`, and run your test in the context of the `Req` supplied by `testReq`.

The first step is to add Lift's Test Kit as dependency to your project in _build.sbt_:

[source, scala]
-------
libraryDependencies += "net.liftweb" %% "lift-testkit" % "2.5-RC5" % "test"
-------

To demonstrate how to use `testReq` we will test a function that detects a Google crawler. Google identifies
crawlers via various `User-Agent` header on a request, so the function we want to test would look like this:

[source, scala]
-------
package code.lib

import net.liftweb.http.Req

object RobotDetector {

  val botNames =
    "Googlebot" ::
    "Mediapartners-Google" ::
    "AdsBot-Google" :: Nil

  def known_?(ua: String) =
    botNames.exists(ua contains _)

  def googlebot_?(r: Req) : Boolean =
    r.header("User-Agent").exists(known_?)
}
-------

We have the list of magic `botNames` that Google sends as a user agent, and we define a check, `known_?`, that takes the user agent string and looks to see if any robot satisfies the condition of being contained in that user agent string.

The `googlebot_?` method is given a Lift `Req` object and from this we look up the header.  This evaluates to a `Box[String]`, as it's possible there is no header. We find the answer by seeing if there exists in the `Box` a value that satisfies the `known_?` condition.

To test this, we create a user agent string, prepare a `MockHttpServletRequest` with the header, and use Lift's `MockWeb` to turn the low-level request into a Lift `Req` for us to test with:

[source, scala]
-------
package code.lib

import org.specs2.mutable._
import net.liftweb.mocks.MockHttpServletRequest
import net.liftweb.mockweb.MockWeb

class SingleRobotDetectorSpec extends Specification {

  "Google Bot Detector" should {

    "spot a web crawler" in {

      val userAgent = "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1)"

      // Mock a request with the right header:
      val http = new MockHttpServletRequest()
      http.headers = Map("User-Agent" -> List(userAgent))

      // Test with a Lift Req:
      MockWeb.testReq(http) { r =>
        RobotDetector.googlebot_?(r) must beTrue
      }
    }

  }

}
-------

Running this from SBT with the `test` command would produce:

-------
[info] SingleRobotDetectorSpec
[info]
[info] Google Bot Detector should
[info] + spot a web crawler
[info]
[info] Total for specification SingleRobotDetectorSpec
[info] Finished in 18 ms
[info] 1 example, 0 failure, 0 error
-------

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Although `MockWeb.testReq` is handling the creation of a `Req` for us, the environment for that `Req` is supplied by the `MockHttpServletRequest`. To configure a request, create an instance of the mock and mutate the state of it as required before using it with `testReq`.(((requests, configuring)))

Aside from HTTP headers, you can set cookies, content type, query parameters, the HTTP method, authentication type, and the body.  There are variations on the `body` assignment, which conveniently set the content type depending on the value you assign((("content types, setting:))):

* `JValue` will use content type of `application/json`.
* `NodeSeq` will use `text/xml` (or you can supply an alternative).
* `String` uses `text/plain` (unless you supply an alternative).
* `Array[Byte]` does not set the content type.

Data table
++++++++++

In the example test above it would be tedious to have to set up the same code repeatedly for different user agents.  Specs2's _Data Table_ provides a compact way to run different example values through the same test(((Specs2)))(((Data Table (Spec2)"))):

[source, scala]
-------
package code.lib

import org.specs2._
import matcher._
import net.liftweb.mocks.MockHttpServletRequest
import net.liftweb.mockweb.MockWeb

class RobotDetectorSpec extends Specification with DataTables {

  def is = "Can detect Google robots" ^ {
    "Bot?" || "User Agent" |
    true   !! "Mozilla/5.0 (Googlebot/2.1)" |
    true   !! "Googlebot-Video/1.0" |
    true   !! "Mediapartners-Google" |
    true   !! "AdsBot-Google" |
    false  !! "Mozilla/5.0 (KHTML, like Gecko)" |> {
    (expectedResult, userAgent) => {
      val http = new MockHttpServletRequest()
      http.headers = Map("User-Agent" -> List(userAgent))
      MockWeb.testReq(http) { r =>
        RobotDetector.googlebot_?(r) must_== expectedResult
      }
     }
    }

  }

}
-------

The core of this test is essentially unchanged: we create a mock, set the user agent, and check the result of `googlebot_?`.  The difference is that Specs2 is providing a neat way to list
out the various scenarios and pipe them through a function.

The output from running this under SBT would be:

-------
[info] Can detect Google robots
[info] + Bot?  | User Agent
[info]   true  | Mozilla/5.0 (Googlebot/2.1)
[info]   true  | Googlebot-Video/1.0
[info]   true  | Mediapartners-Google
[info]   true  | AdsBot-Google
[info]   false | Mozilla/5.0 (KHTML, like Gecko)
[info]
[info] Total for specification RobotDetectorSpec
[info] Finished in 1 ms
[info] 1 example, 0 failure, 0 error
-------

Although the expected value appears first in our table, there's no requirement to put it first.

[[Textile]]
Rendering Textile Markup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to render Textile markup in your web application.(((textile markup)))((("Lift Web Framework", "Textile module")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Install the Lift Textile module in your _build.sbt_ file by adding the
following to the list of dependencies:

[source,scala]
----
"net.liftmodules" %% "textile_2.5" % "1.3"
----

You can then use the module to render Textile using the `toHtml` method.

For example, starting SBT after adding the module and running the SBT `console` command allows you to try out the module:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
scala> import net.liftmodules.textile._
import net.liftmodules.textile._

scala> TextileParser.toHtml("""
 | h1. Hi!
 |
 | The module in "Lift":http://www.liftweb.net for turning Textile markup
 | into HTML is pretty easy to use.
 |
 | * As you can see.
 | * In this example.
 | """)
res0: scala.xml.NodeSeq =
NodeSeq(, <h1>Hi!</h1>,
---------------------------------------------------------
[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
, <p>The module in <a href="http://www.liftweb.net">Lift</a> for turning Textile

, <ul><li> As you can see.</li>
<li> In this example.</li>
</ul>,
, )

---------------------------------------------------------

It's a little easier to see the output if we pretty print it:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
scala> val pp = new PrettyPrinter(width=35, step=2)
pp: scala.xml.PrettyPrinter = scala.xml.PrettyPrinter@54c19de8

scala> pp.formatNodes(res0)
res1: String =

</ul>
---------------------------------------------------------

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

There's nothing special code has to do to become a Lift module, although there are common conventions: they typically are packaged as _net.liftmodules_, but don't have to be; they usually depend on a version of Lift; they sometimes use the hooks provided by `LiftRules` to provide a particular behaviour.  Anyone can create and publish a Lift module, and anyone can contribute to existing modules. In the end, they are declared as dependencies in SBT, and pulled into your code just like any other dependency.

The dependency name is made up of two elements: the name and the "edition" of Lift that the module is compatible with, as shown in <<ModuleVersioning>>. By "edition" we just mean the first part of the Lift version number. This implies the module is compatible with any Lift release that starts "2.5."

[[ModuleVersioning]]
.The structure of a module version
image::images/lfcb_0201.png[]

This structure has been adopted because modules have their own release cycle, independent of Lift. However, modules may also depend on certain features of Lift, and Lift may change APIs between major releases, hence the need to use part of the Lift version number to identify the module.
