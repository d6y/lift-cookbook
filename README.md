## How to Generate HTML

We're using Pamflet to generate the HTML. There are two ways to invoke Pamflet.

### Command Line

Install [_cs_ and then _pf_](http://pamflet.databinder.net/Combined+Pages.html#On+the+Command+Line
) to preview the content of _docs/_ on your local machine.

### SBT Plugin

Simply start SBT and run `start-pamflet` to start the server for live viewing or `write-pamflet` to generate the HTML.

## Todo:

* decide if this is a dumb idea or not.
* Find out how to use images with Pamflet.
* Find out how to link between sections with Pamflet/markdown.
* curate wiki content into this format.
