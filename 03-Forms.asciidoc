[[Forms]]
Forms Processing in Lift
------------------------

This chapter looks at how to process form data with Lift: submitting forms, working with form elements. The end result of a form submission can be records being updated in a database, so you may also find <<Squeryl>> or <<MongoRecord>> useful, as they discuss relational databases and MongoDB, respectively.((("Lift Web Framework", "form processing in", id="ix_LWFfp", range="startofrange")))

To the extent that form processing is passing data to a server, there are also recipes in <<Ajax>> that are relevant to form processing.

You'll find many of the examples from this chapter as source code at https://github.com/LiftCookbook/cookbook_forms[https://github.com/LiftCookbook/cookbook_forms].


[[PlainFormProcessing]]
Plain Old Form Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to process form data in a regular, old-fashioned, non-Ajax, way.((("forms processing", "routine (non-Ajax) methods")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Extract form values with `S.param`, process the values, and produce some output.((("S.param")))(((requests, processing with S.param)))

For example, we can show a form, process an input value, and give a message back as a notice.  The template is a regular HTML form, with the addition of a snippet:


[source,html]
------------------
<form data-lift="Plain" action="/plain" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="What's your name?">
  <input type="submit" value="Go">
</form>
------------------

In the snippet, we can pick out the value of the field `name` with `S.param("name")`:

[source,scala]
------------------
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.common.Full
import net.liftweb.http.S
import net.liftweb.util.PassThru

object Plain {

  def render = S.param("name") match {
    case Full(name) =>
      S.notice("Hello "+name)
      S.redirectTo("/plain")
    case _ =>
      PassThru
  }

}
------------------

The first time through this snippet there will be no parameter so we just pass back the form unchanged to the browser, which is what `PassThru` is doing. You can then enter a value into the `name` field and submit the form. This will result in Lift processing the template again, but this time with a value for the `name` input.  The result will be your browser redirected to a page with a message set for display.


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Manually plucking parameters from a request isn't making the best use of Lift, but sometimes you need to do it, and `S.param` is the way you can process request parameters.((("parameters, manual selection of")))


The result of `S.param` is a `Box[String]`, and in the above example we pattern match on this value.  With more than one parameter, you've probably seen `S.param` used in this way:

[source,scala]
------------------
def render = {
  for {
    name <- S.param("name")
    pet <- S.param("petName")
  } {
    S.notice("Hello %s and %s".format(name,pet))
    S.redirectTo("/plain")
  }

 PassThru
}
------------------

If both `name` and `petName` are provided, the body of the `for` will be evaluated.


Related functions on `S` include:

`S.params(name)`:: Produces a `List[String]` for all the request parameters with the given name
`S.post_?` and `S.get_?`:: Tells you if the request was a GET or POST
`S.getRequestHeader(name)`:: Gives the `Box[String]` for a header in the request with the given name
`S.request`:: Accesses the `Box[Req]`, which gives you access to further HTTP-specific information about the request

As an example of using `S.request`, we could produce a `List[String]` for the values of all request parameters that have `name` somewhere in their parameter name:

[source,scala]
------------------
val names = for {
  req <- S.request.toList
  paramName <- req.paramNames
  if paramName.toLowerCase contains "name"
  value <- S.param(paramName)
} yield value
------------------

Note that by opening up `S.request` we can access all the parameter names via `paramNames` function on `Req`.

Screen or Wizard provide alternatives for form processing, but sometimes
you just want to pull values from a request, as demonstrated in this
recipe.

[[AjaxFormProcessing]]
Ajax Form Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to process a form on the server via Ajax, without reloading the
whole page.((("forms processing", "via Ajax")))(((Ajax, form processing via)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Mark your form as an Ajax form with `data-lift="form.ajax"` and supply a
function to run on the server when the form is submitted.

Here's an example of a form that will collect our name, and submit it via Ajax to the server:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<form data-lift="form.ajax">
  <div data-lift="EchoForm">
    <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="What's your name?">
    <input type="submit">
  </div>
</form>

<div id="result">Your name will be echoed here</div>
---------------------------------------------------------

The following snippet will echo back the name via Ajax:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml.{text,ajaxSubmit}
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmd
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.SetHtml
import xml.Text

object EchoForm extends {

  def render = {

    var name = ""

    def process() : JsCmd = SetHtml("result", Text(name))

    "@name" #> text(name, s => name = s) &
    "type=submit" #> ajaxSubmit("Click Me", process)
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------

The `render` method is binding the name input field to a function that will assign whatever the user enters to the variable `name`. Note you'll more typically see `s => name = s` written in the shorter form of `name = _`.

When the button is pressed, the `process` function is called, which will return the
value of the `name` back to the element in the HTML with an ID of `result`.


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The `data-lift="form.ajax"` part of this recipe ensures that Lift adds the Ajax processing mechanics to the form.  This means the `<form>` element in the output will end up as something like:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<form id="F2203365740CJME2G" action="javascript://"
  onsubmit="liftAjax.lift_ajaxHandler(
    jQuery('#'+&quot;F2203365740CJME2G&quot;).serialize(),
    null, null, &quot;javascript&quot;);return false;">
  ...
</form>
---------------------------------------------------------

In other words, when the form is asked to submit, Lift will serialise the form via Ajax.  This means you don't necessarily need the submit button at all.  In this example with a single text field, if you omit the submit button you can trigger serialisation by pressing Return.  This will trigger the `s => name = s` function, which was bound in our regular `data-lift="EchoForm"` snippet. In other words, the value `name` will be assigned even without a submit button.

Adding in a submit button gives us a way to perform actions once all the field's functions have been executed.(((submit buttons)))

Notice that Lift's approach is to serialise the form to the server, execute the functions associated with the fields, execute the submit function (if any), then return a JavaScript result to the client.  The default serialisation process is to use jQuery's `serialization` method on the form.  This serialises fields except submit buttons and file uploads.

Submit styling
++++++++++++++

The `SHtml.ajaxSubmit` function generates a `<input type="submit">` element for the page. You may prefer to use a styled button for submit. For example, with Twitter Bootstrap, a button with an icon would require the following markup(((submit styling))):

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<button id="submit" class="btn btn-primary btn-large">
  <i class="icon-white icon-ok"></i> Submit
</button>
---------------------------------------------------------

Pressing a `<button>` inside a form triggers the submit. However, if you bound that button with `SHtml.ajaxSubmit`, the content, and therefore the styling, would be lost.

To fix this you can assign a function to a hidden field. This function will be called when the form is submitted just like any other field.  The only part of our snippet that changes is the CSS selector binding(((hidden fields))):

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml.hidden

"@name" #> text(name, s => name = s) &
"button *+" #> hidden(process)
---------------------------------------------------------

The `*+` replacement rule means append a value to the child node of the button. This will include a hidden field in the form, something like this(((replacement rules))):

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
<input type="hidden" name="F11202029628285OIEC2" value="true">
---------------------------------------------------------


and when the form is submitted, the hidden field is submitted, and like any field, Lift will call the function associated with it: `process` in this case.

The effect is something like `ajaxSubmit`, but not exactly the same. In this instance we're appending a hidden field after the `<button>`, but you could place it anywhere on the form you find convenient. However, there's one complication: when is `process` called? Is it before the `name` has been assigned or after? That depends on the order the fields are rendered.  That's to say, in your HTML template, placing the button before the text field (and therefore moving the hidden field's position in this example), the `process` function is called before the name has been set.(((functions, order of execution)))

There are a couple of ways around that.  Either, ensure your hidden fields used in this way appear late in your form, or make sure the function is called late(((formGroup function))) with a `formGroup`:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml.hidden
import net.liftweb.http.S

"@name" #> text(name, s => name = s) &
"button *+" #> S.formGroup(1000) { hidden(process) }
---------------------------------------------------------

The `formGroup` addition manipulates the function identifier to ensure it sorts later, resulting in the function `process` being called later than fields in the default group (0).

[NOTE]
Lift 2.6 and 3.0 may contain `ajaxOnSubmit`, which will give the reliability of `ajaxSubmit` and the flexibility of the hidden-field approach.  If you want to try it in Lift 2.5,
Antonio Salazar Cardozo has created a https://gist.github.com/Shadowfiend/5042131[helper you can include in your project].

[[JsonForms]]
Ajax JSON Form Processing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to process a form via Ajax, sending the data in JSON format.((("forms processing", "Ajax JSON format", id="ix_FPajxjson", range="startofrange")))((("JSON format", "form processing in", id="ix_JSONfp", range="startofrange")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Make use of Lift's _jlift.js_ JavaScript library and `JsonHandler` class.(((JsonHandler class)))(((jlift.js JavaScript library)))

As an example, we can create a "motto server" that will accept an institution name and the institution's motto
and perform some action on these values. We're just going to echo the name and motto back to the client.(((motto servers)))

Consider this HTML, which is not in a form, but includes _jlift.js_:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<html>
<head>
  <title>JSON Form</title>
</head>
<body data-lift-content-id="main">

<div id="main" data-lift="surround?with=default;at=content">

  <h1>Json Form example</h1>

  <!-- Required for JSON forms processing -->
  <script src="/classpath/jlift.js" data-lift="tail"></script>

  <div data-lift="JsonForm" >

    <script id="jsonScript" data-lift="tail"></script>

    <div id="jsonForm">

      <label for="name">
        Institution
        <input id="name" type="text" name="name" value="Royal Society" />
      </label>

      <label for="motto">
        Motto
        <input id="motto" type="text" name="motto" value="Nullius in verba" />
      </label>

      <input type="submit" value="Send" />

    </div>

    <div id="result">
      Result will appear here.
    </div>

  </div>

</div>
</body>
</html>
---------------------------------------------------------

This HTML presents the user with two fields, a name and a motto, wrapped in a `<div>` called `jsonForm`. There's also a placeholder for some results, and you'll  notice a `jsonScript` placeholder for some JavaScript code. The `jsonForm` will be manipulated to ensure it is sent via Ajax, and the `jsonScript` will be replaced with Lift's code to perform the serialisation. This happens in the snippet code:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import scala.xml.{Text, NodeSeq}

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.util.JsonCmd
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml.jsonForm
import net.liftweb.http.JsonHandler
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmd
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.{SetHtml, Script}

object JsonForm {

  def render =
    "#jsonForm" #> ((ns:NodeSeq) => jsonForm(MottoServer, ns)) &
    "#jsonScript" #> Script(MottoServer.jsCmd)

  object MottoServer extends JsonHandler {

    def apply(in: Any): JsCmd = in match {
      case JsonCmd("processForm", target, params: Map[String, String], all) =>
        val name = params.getOrElse("name", "No Name")
        val motto = params.getOrElse("motto", "No Motto")
        SetHtml("result",
          Text("The motto of %s is %s".format(name,motto)) )
    }
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------

Like many snippets, this Scala code contains a `render` method that binds to elements on the page. Specifically, `jsonForm` is being replaced with `SHtml.jsonForm`, which will take a `NodeSeq` (which are the input fields) turns it into a form that will submit the values as JSON. The submission will be to our `MottoServer` code.(((SHtml.jsonForm method)))

The `jsonScript` element is bound to JavaScript that will perform the transmission and encoding of the values to the server.

If you click the "Send" button and observe the network traffic, you'll see
the following sent to the server:

[source,javascript]
---------------------------------------------------------
{
  "command": "processForm",
  "params": {"name":"Royal Society","motto":"Nullius in verba"}
}
---------------------------------------------------------

This is the value of the `all` parameter in the `JsonCmd` being pattern matched against in `MottoServer.apply`. Lift has taken care of the plumbing to make this happen.

The result of the pattern match in the example is to pick out the two field values, and send back JavaScript to update the `results` `<div>` with:
"The motto of the Royal Society is Nullius in verba."


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The `JsonHandler` class and the `SHtml.jsonForm` method are together performing a lot of work for us.  The `jsonForm` method is arranging for form fields to be encoded as JSON and sent, via Ajax, to our `MottoServer` as a `JsonCmd`. In fact, it's a `JsonCmd` with a default command name of `"processForm"`.

Our `MottoServer` class is looking for (matching on) this `JsonCmd`, extracting the values of the form fields, and echoing these back to the client as a `JsCmd` that updates a `<div>` on the page.

The `MottoServer.jsCmd` part is generating the JavaScript required to deliver the form fields to the server.  As we will see later, this is providing a general purpose function we can use to send different JSON values and commands to the server.

Notice also, from the network traffic, that the form fields sent are serialised with the names they are given on the page. There are no "F..." values sent that map to function calls on the server. A consequence of this is that any fields dynamically added to the page will also be serialised to the server, where they can be picked up in the `MottoServer`.

The script _jlift.js_ is providing the plumbing to make much of this happen.

Before going on, convince yourself that we're generating JavaScript on the server side (`MottoServer.jsCmd`), which is executed on the client side when the form is submitted, to deliver results to the server.

Additional commands
+++++++++++++++++++

In the above example, we match on a `JsonCmd` with a command name of `"processForm"`.  You may be wondering what other command can be supplied, or what the meaning of the "target" value is.

To demonstrate how you can implement other commands, we can add two additional buttons. These buttons will just convert the motto to upper- or lowercase.  The server-side `render` method changes as follows:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
def render =
  "#jsonForm" #> ((ns:NodeSeq) => jsonForm(MottoServer, ns)) &
  "#jsonScript" #> Script(
    MottoServer.jsCmd &
    Function("changeCase", List("direction"),
      MottoServer.call("processCase", JsVar("direction"),
        JsRaw("$('#motto').val()"))
    )
  )
---------------------------------------------------------

The `JsonForm` is unchanged. We still include `MottoServer.jsCmd`, and we still want to wrap the fields and submit them as before. What we've added
is an extra JavaScript function called `"changeCase"`, which takes one argument called `"direction"` and as a body calls the `MottoServer` with various parameters.  When it is rendered on the page it would appear as something like this:

[source,javascript]
---------------------------------------------------------
function changeCase(direction) {
  F299202CYGIL({'command': "processCase", 'target': direction,
    'params': $('#motto').val() });
}
---------------------------------------------------------

The `F299202CYGIL` function (or similar name) is generated by Lift as part of `MottoServer.jsCmd`, and it is responsible for delivering data
to the server.  The data it is delivering, in this case, is a JSON structure consisting of a different command ("processCase"), a target of whatever
the JavaScript value `direction` evaluates to, and a parameter that is the result of the jQuery expression for the value
of the `"#motto"` form field.

When is the `changeCase` function called?  That's up to us, and one very simple way to call the function would be by this addition to the HTML:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<button onclick="javascript:changeCase('upper')">Upper case the Motto</button>
<button onclick="javascript:changeCase('lower')">Lower case the Motto</button>
---------------------------------------------------------

When either of these buttons are pressed, the result will be a JSON value sent to the server with the command of `"processCase"` and the `"direction"` and `"params"` set accordingly.  All that is left is to modify our `MottoServer` to pick up this `JsonCmd` on the server:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
object MottoServer extends JsonHandler {

  def apply(in: Any): JsCmd = in match {

    case JsonCmd("processForm", target, params: Map[String, String], all) =>
      val name = params.getOrElse("name", "No Name")
      val motto = params.getOrElse("motto", "No Motto")
      SetHtml("result",
        Text("The motto of %s is %s".format(name,motto)) )

    case JsonCmd("processCase", direction, motto: String, all) =>
      val update =
        if (direction == "upper") motto.toUpperCase
        else motto.toLowerCase
      SetValById("motto", update)

  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------

The first `JsonCmd` is unchanged. The second matches on the parameters sent and results in updating the form fields with an upper- or lowercase version of the motto.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_FPajxjson")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_JSONfp")))

[[DatePicker]]
Use a Date Picker for Input
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to provide a date picker to make it easy for users to supply
dates to your forms.((("forms processing", "date picker input")))(((date pickers)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use a standard Lift `SHtml.text` input field and attach a JavaScript date picker to it.  In this example, we will use the jQuery UI date picker.(((SHtml.text input field)))(((jQuery UI date picker)))

Our form will include an input field called `birthday` to be used as a date picker, and also the jQuery UI JavaScript and CSS:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
  <meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="content-type" />
  <title>jQuery Date Picker</title>
</head>
<body data-lift-content-id="main">
<div id="main" data-lift="surround?with=default;at=content">

  <h3>When's your birthday?</h3>

  <link data-lift="head" type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"
    href="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.2/css/smoothness
          /jquery-ui-1.10.2.custom.min.css">
  </link>

  <script data-lift="tail"
    src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.10.2/jquery-ui.min.js">
  </script>

  <div data-lift="JqDatePicker?form=post">
    <input type="text" id="birthday">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
  </div>

</div>
</body>
</html>
---------------------------------------------------------

This would normally produce a regular text input field, but we can change that by adding JavaScript to attach the date picker to the input field.  You could do this in the template, but in this example we're enhancing the text field as part of the snippet code:


[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import java.util.Date
import java.text.SimpleDateFormat

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.{S, SHtml}
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.Run
import net.liftweb.common.Loggable

class JqDatePicker extends Loggable {

  val dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("yyyy-MM-dd")

  val default = (dateFormat format now)

  def logDate(s: String) : Unit = {
    val date : Date = tryo(dateFormat parse s) getOrElse now
    logger.info("Birthday: "+date)
  }

  def render = {
    S.appendJs(enhance)
    "#birthday" #> SHtml.text(default, logDate)
  }

  val enhance =
    Run("$('#birthday').datepicker({dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd'});")
}
---------------------------------------------------------

Notice in `render` we are binding a regular `SHtml.text` field to the element with the ID of "birthday," but also appending JavaScript to the page.  That JavaScript selects the birthday input field and attaches a configured date picker to it.

When the field is submitted, the `logDate` method is called with the value of the text field. We parse the text into a `java.util.Date` object.  The `tryo` Lift helper will catch any `ParseException` and return a `Box[Date]`, which we open, or default to the current date if a bad date is supplied.

Running this code and submitting the form will produce a log message something like this:

---------------------------------------------------------
INFO  code.snippet.DatePicker - Birthday: Sun Apr 21 00:00:00 BST 2013
---------------------------------------------------------

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The approach outlined in this recipe can be used with other date picker libraries. The key point is to configure the date picker to submit a date in a format you can parse when the value is submitted to the server. This is the "wire format" of the date, and does not have to necessarily be the same format the user sees in the browser, depending on the browser or the JavaScript library being used.((("wire formats, for dates")))

HTML5 Date Pickers
+++++++++++++++++++

The HTML5 specification includes support for a variety of date input types: `datetime`, `datetime-local`, `date`, `month`, `time`, `week`. For example(((HTML5 date pickers))):

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<input type="date" name="birthday" value="2013-04-21">
---------------------------------------------------------

This type of input field will submit a date in _yyyy-mm-dd_ format, which our snippet would be able to process.

As more browsers implement these types it will become possible to depend on them.  However, you can default to the HTML5 browser-native date pickers today and fall back to a JavaScript library as required.((("Safari, date picker format")))((("Chrome, date picker format"))) The difference is shown in <<DatePickerScreenGrabs>>.

[[DatePickerScreenGrabs]]
.An input field with the jQuery UI date picker attached, compared to the browser-native date picker in Chrome
image::images/lfcb_0301.png[]

To detect if the browser supports `type="date"` inputs, we can use the _Modernizr_ library.  This is an additional script in our template((("browsers", "detecting features in"))):

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<script data-lift="tail"
  src="//cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/modernizr/2.6.2/modernizr.min.js">
</script>
---------------------------------------------------------

We will use this in our snippet. In fact, there are  two changes we need to make to the snippet:

1. Add the `type="date"` attribute to the input field; and

2. Modify the JavaScript to only attach the jQuery UI date picker in browsers that don't support the `type="date"` input.

In code, that becomes:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
def render = {
  S.appendJs(enhance)
  "#birthday" #> SHtml.text(default, logDate, ("type"->"date"))
}

val enhance = Run(
  """
    |if (!Modernizr.inputtypes.date) {
    | $('input[type=date]').datepicker({dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd'});
    |}
  """.stripMargin)

The `"type" -> "date"` parameter on `SHtml.text` is setting the attribute "type" to the value "date" on the resulting `<input>` field.

When this snippet runs, and the page is rendered, the jQuery UI date picker will be attached to input fields of `type="date"` only if the browser doesn't support that type already.

[[Autocomplete]]
Making Suggestions with Autocomplete
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to provide an autocomplete widget, to give users suggestions as they type into a text field.((("forms processing", "autocomplete suggestions", id="ix_FPauto", range="startofrange")))((("autocomplete suggestions", id="ix_autocomp", range="startofrange")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use a JavaScript autocomplete widget, for example the jQuery UI autocomplete via the `AutoComplete` class from the Lift Widgets module.(((jQuery UI autocomplete)))(((Lift Web Framework, Widgets module)))(((Lift modules)))(((autocomplete suggestions, jQuery UI for)))

Start by adding the Lift widgets module to your _build.sbt_:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------
libraryDependencies += "net.liftmodules" %% "widgets_2.5" % "1.3"
-------------------------------------------

To enable the autocomplete widget, initialize it in _Boot.scala_:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------
import net.liftmodules.widgets.autocomplete.AutoComplete
AutoComplete.init()
-------------------------------------------

We can create a regular form snippet:

[source,html]
-------------------------------------------
<form data-lift="ProgrammingLanguages?form=post">
  <input id="autocomplete">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
-------------------------------------------

and connect the `AutoComplete` class to the element with the ID of "autocomplete":

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.common.Loggable

import net.liftmodules.widgets.autocomplete.AutoComplete

class ProgrammingLanguages extends Loggable {

  val languages = List(
    "C", "C++", "Clojure", "CoffeeScript",
    "Java", "JavaScript",
    "POP-11", "Prolog", "Python", "Processing",
    "Scala", "Scheme", "Smalltalk", "SuperCollider"
  )

  def render = {

    val default = ""

    def suggest(value: String, limit: Int) =
      languages.filter(_.toLowerCase.startsWith(value))

    def submit(value: String) : Unit =
      logger.info("Value submitted: "+value)

    "#autocomplete" #> AutoComplete(default, suggest, submit)
  }

}
-------------------------------------------

The last line of this snippet shows the binding of the `AutoComplete` class, which takes:

* A default value to show;
* A function that will produce suggestions from the text value entered—the result is a `Seq[String]` suggestions; and
* A function to call when the form is submitted.

Running this code renders as shown in <<AutoCompleteWidgetScreenGrab>>.

[[AutoCompleteWidgetScreenGrab]]

image::images/lfcb_0302.png[]

When the form is submitted, the `submit` function will be passed the selected value. The `submit` function is simply logging this value:

-------------------------------------------
 INFO  code.snippet.ProgrammingLanguages - Value submitted: Scala
-------------------------------------------


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The autocomplete widget uses jQuery autocomplete. This can be seen by examining the `NodeSeq` produced by the `AutoComplete.apply` method:

[source,html]
-------------------------------------------
 <span>
  <head>
  <link type="text/css" rel="stylesheet"
    href="/classpath/autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.css">
  </link>
  <script type="text/javascript"
    src="/classpath/autocomplete/jquery.autocomplete.js">
  </script>
  <script type="text/javascript">
// <![CDATA[
  jQuery(document).ready(function(){
    var data = "/ajax_request?F846528841915S2RBI0=foo";
    jQuery("#F846528841916S3QZ0V").
      autocomplete(data, {minChars:0,matchContains:true}).
      result(function(event, dt, formatted) {
       jQuery("#F846528841917CF4ZGL").val(formatted);
      }
     );
  });;
// ]]>
</script>
  </head>
  <input type="text" value="" id="F846528841916S3QZ0V"></input>
  <input name="F846528841917CF4ZGL" type="hidden" value=""
   id="F846528841917CF4ZGL"></input>
</span>
-------------------------------------------

This chunk of markup is generated from the `AutoComplete(default, suggest, submit)` call. What's happening here is that the jQuery UI autocomplete JavaScript and CSS, which is bundled with the Lift Widgets module, is being included on the page. Recall from <<AddToHead>> that Lift will merge the `<head>` part of this markup into the `<head>` of the final HTML page.

When the page loads, the jQuery UI `autocomplete` function is bound to the input field, and configured with a URL which will deliver the user's input to our `suggest` function.  All `suggest` needs to do is return a `Seq[String]` of values for the jQuery autocomplete code to display to the user.


Submitting new values
+++++++++++++++++++++

One peculiarity of the `AutoComplete` widget is that if you type in a new value--one not suggested--and press submit, it is not sent to the server.  That is, you need to click on one of the suggestions to select it.  If that's not the behaviour you want, you can adjust it.(((autocomplete suggestions, new values and)))

Inside the `render` method we can modify the behaviour by adding JavaScript to the page:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------
import net.liftweb.http.S
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.Run
S.appendJs(Run(
"""
  |$('#autocomplete input[type=text]').bind('blur',function() {
  |  $(this).next().val($(this).val());
  |});
""".stripMargin))
-------------------------------------------

With this in place, when the input field loses focus, for example when the submit button is pressed,
the value of the input field is stored as the value to be sent to the server.

Alternative auto complete JavaScript
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Looking at the way the widget module builds autocomplete functionality may give you an insight into how you can incorporate other JavaScript autocomplete libraries into your Lift application.  The idea is to include the JavaScript library, connect it to an element on the page, and then arrange for the server to be called to generate suggestions.  Of course, if you only have a few items for the user to pick from, you could just include those items on the page, rather than making a round trip to the server.(((autocomplete suggestions, alternative libraries for)))

As an example of server-generated suggestions, we can look at the _Typeahead_ component that is included in Twitter Bootstrap.(((Typeahead component)))

To incorporate Typeahead, the template needs to change to include the library and mark the input field in the way Typeahead expects:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------
<link data-lift="head" rel="stylesheet"
  href="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.1/css/bootstrap-combined.min.css">

<script data-lift="tail"
  src="//netdna.bootstrapcdn.com/twitter-bootstrap/2.3.1/js/bootstrap.min.js">
</script>

<form data-lift="ProgrammingLanguagesTypeAhead">
  <script id="js"></script>
  <input id="autocomplete" type="text"
    data-provide="typeahead" autocomplete="off">
  <input type="submit">
</form>
-------------------------------------------

We've included a placeholder with an ID of "js" for the JavaScript that will call back to the server. We'll get to that in a moment.

The way Typeahead works is that we attach it to our input field, and tell it to call a JavaScript function when it need to make suggestions.  That JavaScript function is going to be called `askServer`, and it is given two arguments: the input the user has typed so far (`query`), and a JavaScript function to call when the suggestions are available (`callback`).  The Lift snippet needs to use the `query` value and then call the JavaScript `callback` function with whatever suggestions are made.

A snippet to implement this would be as follows:

[source,scala]
-------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.common.{Full, Empty, Loggable}

import net.liftweb.http._
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds._
import net.liftweb.http.js.JsCmds.Run
import net.liftweb.http.js.JE.JsVar
import net.liftweb.json.JsonAST._
import net.liftweb.json.DefaultFormats

class ProgrammingLanguagesTypeAhead extends Loggable {

  val languages = List(
    "C", "C++", "Clojure", "CoffeeScript",
    "Java", "JavaScript",
    "POP-11", "Prolog", "Python", "Processing",
    "Scala", "Scheme", "Smalltalk", "SuperCollider"
  )

  def render = {

    implicit val formats = DefaultFormats

    def suggest(value: JValue) : JValue = {
      logger.info("Making suggestion for: "+value)

      val matches = for {
        q <- value.extractOpt[String].map(_.toLowerCase).toList
        lang <- languages.filter(_.toLowerCase startsWith q)
      } yield JString(lang)

      JArray(matches)
    }

    val callbackContext = new JsonContext(Full("callback"),Empty)

    val runSuggestion =
      SHtml.jsonCall(JsVar("query"), callbackContext, suggest _ )

    S.appendJs(Run(
      """
        |$('#autocomplete').typeahead({
        |  source: askServer
        |});
      """.stripMargin))

    "#js *" #> Function("askServer", "query" :: "callback" :: Nil,
                  Run(runSuggestion.toJsCmd)) &
    "#autocomplete" #> SHtml.text("", s => logger.info("Submitted: "+s))

  }
}
-------------------------------------------

Working from the bottom of the snippet, we bind a regular Lift `SHtml.text` input to the autocomplete field.  This will receive the selected value when the form is submitted.  We also bind the JavaScript placeholder to a JavaScript function definition called `askServer`.  This is the function that Typeahead will call when it wants suggestions.

The JavaScript function we're defining takes two arguments: the `query` and `callback`. The body of `askServer` causes it to run something called `runSuggestion`, which is a `jsonCall` to the server, with the value of the `query`.

The suggestions are made by the `suggest` function, which expects to be able to find a `String` in the passed in JSON value. It uses this value to find matches in the list of `languages`.  These are returned as a `JArray` of `JString`, which is treated as JSON data back on the client.

What does the client do with the data? It calls the `callback` function with the suggestions, which results in the display updating. We specify that it's `callback` via `JsonContext`, which is a class that lets us specify a custom function to call on success of the request to the server.

It may help to understand this by looking at the JavaScript generated in the HTML page for `askServer`:

[source,html]
-------------------------------------------
<script id="js">
function askServer(query, callback) {
  liftAjax.lift_ajaxHandler('F268944843717UZB5J0=' +
    encodeURIComponent(JSON.stringify(query)), callback, null, "json")
}
</script>
-------------------------------------------

As the user types into the text field, Typeahead calls `askServer` with the input supplied. Lift's Ajax support arranges for that value, `query`, to be  serialised to our `suggest` function on the server, and for the results to be passed to `callback`. At that point, Typeahead takes over again and displays the suggestions.

Typing "Scala" to the text field and pressing submit will produce a sequence like this on the server:

-------------------------------------------
INFO  c.s.ProgrammingLanguagesTypeAhead - Making suggestion for: JString(Sc)
INFO  c.s.ProgrammingLanguagesTypeAhead - Making suggestion for: JString(Sca)
INFO  c.s.ProgrammingLanguagesTypeAhead - Making suggestion for: JString(Sca)

[[Radio]]
Offering Choices with Radio Buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want users to select an option using radio buttons.((("forms processing", "radio buttons", id="ix_FPradbut", range="startofrange")))((("radio buttons", id="ix_radbut", range="startofrange")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use `SHtml.radioElem` to present the options as radio buttons.

To illustrate this, let's create a form to allow a user to indicate his gender:

[source, scala]
-----------------------------------------------
object BirthGender extends Enumeration {
  type BirthGender = Value
  val Male = Value("Male")
  val Female = Value("Female")
  val NotSpecified = Value("Rather Not Say")
}
-----------------------------------------------

We're using an enumeration, but it could be any class. The `toString` of the class will be used as the label shown to the user.

To present these options and handle the selection of an option, we use this enumeration in a snippet:

[source, scala]
-----------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.common._
import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml.ChoiceHolder

object Radio extends Loggable {

  import BirthGender._

  val options : Seq[BirthGender] = BirthGender.values.toSeq

  val default : Box[BirthGender] = Empty

  val radio : ChoiceHolder[BirthGender] =
    SHtml.radioElem(options, default) { selected =>
      logger.info("Choice: "+selected)
    }

  def render = ".options" #> radio.toForm
}
-----------------------------------------------

Rather than generate the radio buttons in one expression on the `render` method, we've pulled out the intermediate values to show their types. The `radio.toForm` call is generating the radio buttons, and we're binding them to the CSS selector `.option` in the following template:

[source, html]
-----------------------------------------------
<div data-lift="Radio?form=post">

  <span class="options">
    <input type="radio">Option 1</input>
    <input type="radio">Option 2</input>
  </span>

  <input type="submit" value="Submit">

</div>
-----------------------------------------------

The `class="options"` span will be replaced with the radio buttons from the code, and when the form is submitted, the function supplied to `SHtml.radioElem` will be called, resulting in the selected value being logged. For example:

-----------------------------------------------
INFO  code.snippet.Radio - Choice: Empty
-----------------------------------------------

if no radio button is selected, and:

-----------------------------------------------
INFO  code.snippet.Radio - Choice: Full(Rather Not Say)
-----------------------------------------------

if the third button was selected.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Many of the Lift `SHtml` methods return a `NodeSeq`, which can be directly bound into our HTML. However, `radioElem` is different in that it gives us a `ChoiceHolder[T]`, and to generate a `NodeSeq` from that, we're calling `toForm`.  This has implications for how you customise radio buttons, as we'll see later.

The `radioElem` method expects three parameters:

[source, scala]
-----------------------------------------------
SHtml.radioElem(options, default) { selected =>
  logger.info("Choice: "+selected)
}
-----------------------------------------------

The first is the set of options to show, as a `Seq[T]`. The second is the value to be preselected as a `Box[T]`.  In the example, we have no preselected value, which is represented as `Empty`.  Finally, there's the function to run when the form is submitted, of type `Box[T] => Any`.

Note that even if the user selects no value, your function will be called, and it will be passed the value `Empty`.

To understand a little more of what's happening, take a look at the default HTML produced by `radioElem`:

[source, html]
-----------------------------------------------
<span>
 <input value="F317293945993CDMQZ" type="radio" name="F317293946030HYAFP">
 <input name="F317293946030HYAFP" type="hidden" value="F317293946022HCGEG">
 Male<br>
</span>
<span>
 <input value="F31729394600RIE253" type="radio" name="F317293946030HYAFP">
 Female<br>
</span>
<span>
 <input value="F317293946011OMEMM" type="radio" name="F317293946030HYAFP">
 Rather Not Say<br>
</span>
-----------------------------------------------

Notice that:

* All the input fields have the same randomly generated name.
* The input fields have randomly generated values.
* There's a hidden field added to the first item.

This might be a surprise if you were just expecting something like this:

[source, html]
-----------------------------------------------
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="Male">Male<br>
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="Female">Female<br>
<input type="radio" name="gender" value="RatherNotSay">Rather Not Say<br>
-----------------------------------------------

By using random values, Lift has helped us by protecting against a range of form-based attacks, such as submitting values we're not expected, or setting values on fields we don't want set.(((form-based attacks)))(((security, form-based attacks)))

Each of the random radio button values is associated, on the server, with a `BirthGender` value from our `options` sequence. When the form is submitted, Lift picks out the selected value (if any), looks up the corresponding `BirthGender` value, and calls our function.

The hidden field ensures that the function will be called even if no radio button is selected. This is because the browser will at least submit the hidden field, and this is enough to trigger the server-side function.(((hidden fields)))


Customising the HTML
++++++++++++++++++++

The default HTML wraps each radio button in a `<span>` and separates them with a `<br>`.  Let's change that to make it work well with the _Twitter Bootstrap_ framework, and put each choice in a `<lablel>` and give it a class.

To customise the HTML, you need to understand that the `ChoiceHolder` is a container for a sequence of items.  Each item is a `ChoiceItem`:

[source, scala]
-----------------------------------------------
final case class ChoiceItem[T](key: T, xhtml: NodeSeq)
-----------------------------------------------

The `key` in our example is a `BirthGender` instance, and the `xhtml` is the radio button input field (plus the hidden field for the first option).  With this knowledge we can write a helper to generate a `NodeSeq` in the style we want:

[source, scala]
-----------------------------------------------
import scala.xml.NodeSeq
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml.ChoiceItem

object LabelStyle {
  def htmlize[T](item: ChoiceItem[T]) : NodeSeq =
   <label class="radio">{item.xhtml} {item.key.toString}</label>

  def toForm[T](holder: ChoiceHolder[T]) : NodeSeq =
   holder.items.flatMap(htmlize)
}
-----------------------------------------------

The `htmlize` method produces a `<label>` element with the class we want, and it contains the radio input (`item.xhtml`) and the text of the label (`item.key.toString`).  The `toForm` is applying the `htmlize` function to all the choices.

We can apply this in our snippet:

[source, scala]
-----------------------------------------------
def render = ".options" #> LabelStyle.toForm(radio)
-----------------------------------------------

and the result would be the following:

[source, html]
-----------------------------------------------
<label class="radio">
 <input value="F234668654428LWW305" type="radio" name="F234668654432WS5LWK">
 <input name="F234668654432WS5LWK" type="hidden" value="F234668654431KYJB3S">
 Male
</label>
<label class="radio">
 <input value="F234668654429MB5RF3" type="radio" name="F234668654432WS5LWK">
 Female
</label>
<label class="radio">
 <input value="F234668654430YULGC1" type="radio" name="F234668654432WS5LWK">
 Rather Not Say
</label>
-----------------------------------------------

The `toForm` method could be wrapping the choices in some other HTML, such as an `<ul>`. But in this case, it's not: it's just applying `htmlize` to each `ChoiceItem`. As a consequence of this, we could make `LabelStyle` the default across our Lift application:

[source, scala]
-----------------------------------------------
ChoiceHolder.htmlize = c => LabelStyle.htmlize(c)
-----------------------------------------------

This works because `toForm` on `ChoiceHolder` defers to `ChoiceHolder.htmlize`, and `ChoiceHolder.htmlize` is a variable you can assign to.


String values
+++++++++++++

If you want to work directly with `String` values for options, you can use `SHtml.radio`.  Although it too produces a `ChoiceHolder`, it differs from `radioElem` in that it uses the same `String` as both the label and the value. The function associated with each option is only called if a value is selected by the user.(((string values)))

An `SHtml.radio` version of our example would look like this:

[source, scala]
-----------------------------------------------
SHtml.radio(
  "Male" :: "Female" :: "Rather Not Say" :: Nil,
  Empty,
  selected => logger.info("Choice: "+selected)
)
-----------------------------------------------

This is a similar structure to `radioElem`: there's a list of options, a default, a function to call, and it produces a `ChoiceHolder[String]`.  When a form is submitted, our function is passed the `String` value of the selected option. If no radio buttons are selected, the function is not called.(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_FPradbut")))(((range="endofrange", startref="ix_radbut")))

[[DisableCheckbox]]
Conditionally Disable a Checkbox
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want to add the `disabled` attribute to a `SHtml.checkbox` based on
a conditional check.(((forms processing, conditional disablement)))(((checkboxes, conditional disablement of)))(((conditional checks)))((("Lift Web Framework", "CSS selector transforms")))((("CSS selectors", "and disabled attribute")))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Create a CSS selector transform to add the disabled attribute, and apply
it to your checkbox transform.

For example, suppose you have a simple checkbox:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
class Likes {
  var likeTurtles = false
  def render =
    "#like" #> SHtml.checkbox(likeTurtles, likeTurtles = _ )
}
---------------------------------------------------------

and a corresponding template:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
  <meta content="text/html; charset=UTF-8" http-equiv="content-type" />
  <title>Disable Checkboxes</title>
</head>
<body data-lift-content-id="main">
<div id="main" data-lift="surround?with=default;at=content">

  <div>Select the things you like:</div>

  <form data-lift="Likes">
    <label for="like">Do you like turtles?</label>
    <input id="like" type="checkbox">
  </form>

</div>
</body>
</html>
---------------------------------------------------------

Further suppose you want to disable it roughly 50% of the time. We could do that
by adjusting the `NodeSeq` generated from `SHtml.checkbox`:

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.util.PassThru
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml

class Likes {
  var likesTurtles = false

  def disable =
    if (math.random > 0.5d) "* [disabled]" #> "disabled"
    else PassThru

  def render =
    "#like" #> disable( SHtml.checkbox(likesTurtles, likesTurtles = _) )
}
----

When the checkbox is rendered, it will be disabled roughly half the time.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

The `disable` method returns a `NodeSeq => NodeSeq` function, meaning
when we apply it we need to give it a
`NodeSeq`, which is exactly what `SHtml.checkbox` provides.

The `[disabled]` part of the CSS selector is selecting the disabled
attribute and replacing it with the value on the right of the `#>`,
which is "disabled" in this example.

What this combination means is that half the time the disabled attribute
will be set on the checkbox, and half the time the checkbox `NodeSeq`
will be left untouched because `PassThru` does not change the `NodeSeq`.

[[MultiSelectBox]]
Use a Select Box with Multiple Options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

them to select multiple values.((("forms processing", "mulitple values", id="ix_FPmulval", range="startofrange")))(((multiple options)))(((checkboxes, multiple options)))(((select boxes)))

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use `SHtml.multiSelect(options, default, selection)`.  Here's an example where a user can select up to three options:

[source,scala]
----
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml
import net.liftweb.common.Loggable

class MultiSelect extends Loggable {

  case class Item(id: String, name: String)

  val inventory =
    Item("a", "Coffee") ::
    Item("b", "Milk") ::
    Item("c", "Sugar") :: Nil

  val options : List[(String,String)] =
    inventory.map(i => (i.id -> i.name))

  val default = inventory.head.id :: Nil

  def render = {

    def selection(ids: List[String]) : Unit = {
      logger.info("Selected: "+ids)
    }

    "#opts *" #>
      SHtml.multiSelect(options, default, selection)
  }
}
----

In this example, the user is being presented with a list of three items, with the first one selected, as shown in <<MultiSelectExample>>.  When the form is submitted, the `selection` function is called, with a list of the selected option values.

The template to go with the snippet could be:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<div data-lift="MultiSelect?form=post">
  <p>What can I get you?</p>
  <div id="opts">options go here</div>
   <input type="submit" value="Place Order">
</div>
---------------------------------------------------------

This will render as something like:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<form action="/" method="post"><div>
  <p>What can I get you?</p>
  <div id="opts">
   <select name="F25749422319ALP1BW" multiple="true">
     <option value="a" selected="selected">Coffee</option>
     <option value="b">Milk</option>
     <option value="c">Sugar</option>
   </select>
  </div>
  <input value="Place Order" type="submit">
</form>
---------------------------------------------------------

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

Recall that an HTML select consists of a set of options, each of which
has a value and a name. To reflect this, the above example takes our
`inventory` of objects and turns it into a list of string
pairs, called `options`.

The function given to `SHtml.multiSelect` will receive the values (IDs), not
the names, of the options. That is, if you ran the above code, and
selected "Coffee" and "Milk," the function would see `List("a", "b")`.

Selected no options
+++++++++++++++++++

Be aware that if no options are selected, your handling function is
not called. This is described in https://github.com/lift/framework/issues/1139[issue 1139].

One way to work around this is to add a hidden function to reset the list. For example, we
could modify the above code to be a stateful snippet and remember the
values we selected(((hidden functions)))((("functions, hidden"))):

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.{StatefulSnippet, SHtml}
import net.liftweb.common.Loggable

class MultiSelectStateful extends StatefulSnippet with Loggable {

  def dispatch = {
    case _ => render
  }

  case class Item(id: String, name: String)

  val inventory =
    Item("a", "Coffee") ::
    Item("b", "Milk") ::
    Item("c", "Sugar") :: Nil

  val options : List[(String,String)] =
    inventory.map(i => (i.id -> i.name))

  var current = inventory.head.id :: Nil

  def render = {

    def logSelected() =
      logger.info("Values selected: "+current)

    "#opts *" #> (
      SHtml.hidden( () => current = Nil) ++
      SHtml.multiSelect(options, current, current = _)
    ) &
    "type=submit" #> SHtml.onSubmitUnit(logSelected)

  }

}
---------------------------------------------------------

The template is unchanged, and the snippet has been modified to introduce a `current` value and a hidden function to reset the value.  We've bound the submit button to simply log the selected values when the form is submitted.

Each time the form is submitted the `current` list of IDs is set to
whatever you have selected in the browser. But note that we have started
with a hidden function that resets `current` to the empty list. This means
that if the receiving function in `multiSelect` is never called, because nothing is selected, the value stored in `current` would reflect this and be `Nil`.

That may be useful, depending on what behaviour you need in your application.

Type-safe options
+++++++++++++++++

If you don't want to work in terms of `String` values for an option, you
can use `multiSelectObj`. In this variation the list of options still
provides a text name, but the value is in terms of a class. Likewise,
the list of default values will be a list of class instances.

The only changes to the code are to produce a `List[(Item,String)]` for the options, and use an `Item` as a default:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
val options : List[(Item,String)] =
  inventory.map(i => (i -> i.name))

val default = inventory.head :: Nil
---------------------------------------------------------

The call to generate the multiselect from this data is similar, but
note our `selection` function now receives a list of `Item`:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
def render = {

  def selection(items: List[Item]) : Unit = {
    logger.info("Selected: "+items)
  }

  "#opts *" #>
    SHtml.multiSelectObj(options, default, selection)
  }
---------------------------------------------------------

Enumerations
++++++++++++

You can use `multiSelectObj` with enumerations:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml
import net.liftweb.common.Loggable

class MultiSelectEnum extends Loggable {

  object Item extends Enumeration {
    type Item = Value
    val Coffee, Milk, Sugar = Value
  }

  import Item._

  val options : List[(Item,String)] =
    Item.values.toList.map(i => (i -> i.toString))

  val default = Item.Coffee :: Nil

  def render = {

    def selection(items: List[Item]) : Unit = {
      logger.info("Selected: "+items)
    }

    "#opts *" #>
      SHtml.multiSelectObj(options, default, selection)
  }

}
---------------------------------------------------------

The enumeration version works in the same way as the type-safe version.

[[FileUpload]]
File Upload
~~~~~~~~~~~

Problem
^^^^^^^

You want a snippet to allow users to upload a file to your Lift application.

Solution
^^^^^^^^

Use a `FileParamHolder` in your snippet, and extract file information from it when the form is submitted.

Start with a form that is marked as `"multipart=true"`:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<html>
<head>
  <title>File Upload</title>
  <script id="jquery" src="/classpath/jquery.js" type="text/javascript">
  </script>
  <script id="json" src="/classpath/json.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>
<body>
<form data-lift="FileUploadSnippet?form=post;multipart=true">
   <label for="file">
     Select a file: <input id="file"></input>
   </label>
   <input type="submit" value="Submit"></input>
</form>
</body>
</html>
---------------------------------------------------------

We bind the file input to `SHtml.fileUpload` and the submit button to a function to process the uploaded file:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
package code.snippet

import net.liftweb.util.Helpers._
import net.liftweb.http.SHtml._
import net.liftweb.http.FileParamHolder
import net.liftweb.common.{Loggable, Full, Empty, Box}


class FileUploadSnippet extends Loggable {

  def render = {

    var upload : Box[FileParamHolder] = Empty

    def processForm() = upload match {
      case Full(FileParamHolder(_, mimeType, fileName, file)) =>
        logger.info("%s of type %s is %d bytes long" format (
         fileName, mimeType, file.length) )

      case _ => logger.warn("No file?")
    }

    "#file" #> fileUpload(f => upload = Full(f)) &
      "type=submit" #> onSubmitUnit(processForm)
  }
}
---------------------------------------------------------

The `fileUpload` binding ensures that the file is assigned to the `upload` variable. This allows us to access the `Array[Byte]` of the file in the `processForm` method when the form is submitted.


Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^

HTTP includes an encoding type of `"multipart/form-data"` that was introduced to support binary data uploads.  The `?form=post;multipart=true` parameters in the template mark the form with this encoding, and the HTML generated will look
like this:

[source,html]
---------------------------------------------------------
<form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="post" action="/fileupload">
---------------------------------------------------------

When the browser submits the form, Lift detects the `"multipart/form-data"` encoding and extracts any files from the request.  These are available as `uploadedFiles` on a `Req` object, for example:

[source, scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
val files : List[FileParamHolder] = S.request.map(_.uploadedFiles) openOr Nil
---------------------------------------------------------

However, as we're dealing with a form with a single upload field it's easier to use `SHtml.fileUpload` to bind the input to our `upload` variable.  Lift arranges for the function `f => upload = Full(f)` to be called when a file is selected and uploaded via this field. If the file is zero length, the function is not called.

The default behaviour for Lift is to read the file into memory and present it as a `FileParamHolder`.  In this recipe we're pattern matching on the fields of the `FileParamHolder` and simply printing out what we know about the file.  We're ignoring the first parameter, which will be Lift's generated name for the field, but capturing the mime type, original filename, and the raw data that was in the file.

You probably don't want to use this method for very large files.  In fact, `LiftRules` provides a number of size restrictions that you can control:

`LiftRules.maxMimeFileSize`:: The maximum size of any single file uploaded (7 MB by default)

`LiftRules.maxMimeSize`:: The maximum size of the multipart upload in total (8 MB by default)

Why two settings?  Because when the form is submitted, there may be a number of fields on the form.  For example, in the recipe the value of the submit button is sent as one of the parts, and the file is sent as another. Hence, you might want to limit file size, but allow for some field values, or multiple files, to be submitted.

If you hit the size limit an exception will be thrown from the underlying file upload library. You can catch the exception, as described in <<CatchException>>:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
LiftRules.exceptionHandler.prepend {
  case (_, _, x : FileUploadIOException) =>
    ResponseWithReason(BadResponse(), "Unable to process file. Too large?")
}
---------------------------------------------------------

Be aware that the container (Jetty, Tomcat) or any web server (Apache, NGINX) may also have limits on file upload sizes.

[[UploadToDisk]]
Uploading a file into memory may be fine for some situations, but you may want to upload larger items to disk and then process them in Lift as a stream.  Lift supports this via the following setting:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
LiftRules.handleMimeFile = OnDiskFileParamHolder.apply
---------------------------------------------------------

The `handleMimeFile` variable expects to be given a function that takes a field name, mime type, filename, and `InputStream` and returns a `FileParamHolder`.  The default implementation of this is the `InMemFileParamHolder`, but changing to `OnDiskFileParamHolder` means Lift will write the file to disk first. You can of course implement your own handler in addition to using `OnDiskFileParamHolder` or `InMemFileParamHolder`.

With `OnDiskFileParamHolder`, the file will be written to a temporary location (`System.getProperty("java.io.tmpdir")`) but it's up to you to remove it when you're done with the file. For example, our snippet could change to:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
def processForm() = upload match {

  case Full(content : OnDiskFileParamHolder) =>
    logger.info("File: "+content.localFile.getAbsolutePath)
    val in: InputStream = content.fileStream
    // ...do something with the stream here...
    val wasDeleted_? = content.localFile.delete()

  case _ => logger.warn("No file?")
}
---------------------------------------------------------

Be aware that `OnDiskFileParamHolder` implements `FileParamHolder`, so would match the original `FileParamHolder` pattern used in the recipe. However, if you access the `file` field of `OnDiskFileParamHolder`, you'll bring the file into memory, which would defeat the point of storing it on disk to process it as a stream.

If you want to monitor the progress of the upload on the server side, you can. There's a hook in `LiftRules` that is called as the upload is running:

[source,scala]
---------------------------------------------------------
def progressPrinter(bytesRead: Long, contentLength: Long, fieldIndex: Int) {
  println("Read %d of %d for %d" format (bytesRead, contentLength, fieldIndex))
}

LiftRules.progressListener = progressPrinter
---------------------------------------------------------

This is the progress of the whole multipart upload, not just the file being uploaded.  In particular, the `contentLength` may not be known (in which case it will be `-1`), but if it is known it is the size of the complete multipart upload. In the example in this recipe that would include the size of the file, but also the submit button value.  This also explains the `fieldIndex`, which is a counter as to which part is being processed. It will take on the values of 0 and 1 for the two parts in this example.
